L-E,How a shadow is made a light nose on a big object 
L-E,Rainbows are when light goes through rain droplets that act like prisms 
L-E,The order of colors in the rainbow goes Red Orange yellow Green Blue Indigo Violet its in that order because of the light waves red is the longest light wave and violet is the shortest light wave 
L-E,This is how we see different colored objects when you see a yellow flower it is because all the primary colors of light hit it red and green light bounce off of the flower into your eye 
L-E,its the same with magenta except blue  red nonces off 
L-E,its also the same with cyan except blue  green light bounces off 
L-E,Shadows are made when light hits an opaque object and so then it makes shadow The shadow is allays attacher to a opaque object 
L-E,It depends on the time of day for the size of the shadow 
L-E,a convex lens also helps focus the light  
L-E,It dost focus the light  
L-E,If you shine a light through a stem of water you will see a rainbow in the water 
L-E,Wen you see a red rose the blue and green are being absorbed and the red will be reflected and you see a red rose 
L-E,Wen you look at a yellow rose the to colors that are reflected are red and green they make yellow The blue is absorbed and you cant see it 
L-E,Other Lights our when the sun boards the earth with tiny particles of belletristic they hit the earths attester the air and electricity makes it glow 
L-E,A liner elicits is when the sun is behind the earth and the moons in front of the earth 
L-E,Light travels in inviable waves so it acts like a straight line but is actually waves 
L-E,Light wave length is shorter then ultra violet waves which are inviable to our eyes so some people still think that light travels in a straight line It was proved by many people a long time ago 
L-E,A shadow is made by an opaque object nontransparent object and when you shine the light through the opaque object you can see a black spot that black spot is a shadow 
L-E,Solar panels are usably used in places where they want to absorb light what a solar panel is basically is a thing that absorbs light stead of reflecting light so it can give off light later on 
L-E,You have three eye cones in your eyes to SEe different couplers like I said before the easy way to SE many couplers is you need blue red and green so they are blue red and green 
L-E,glowing things is that it needs to absorb light to work 
L-E,A shadow is a reflection of light hitting an object To see a shadow you need a source of light like the sun or a flash light 
L-E,A solar eclipse is when the sun over laps the moon band then the sun and the moon go red 
L-E,This is how a shadow is made  a shadow is made when light hits an object 
L-E,This is why how you make a rainbow with a prism you get a prism and shine a light though the prism and then you will see a prism rainbow
L-E,how we make a rainbow with rain  After it rains you see a rainbow its made by the sun light shining though the water and it makes a rainbow 
L-E,Solar panel absorb light and change it to solar energy 
L-E,My theory about how light travels is that light travels in ripple waves 
L-E,My theory about all we see is light is that every thing we see is light 
L-E,the way a shadow is made is that you are covering part of where the light hits 
L-E,My understanding of rainbows is that the reason that there always in the same order is that Red has the longest light wave and violet the shortest 
L-E,Anything that isn't the same color gets absorbed the same color is always reflected 
L-E,Rainbows are sometimes made when leftover raindrops The raindrops acts as prisms 
L-E,other things make things glow in the dark like electricity heat and friction 
L-E,If you looked into a concave mirror you would see behind you and a lot of light because the light goes in then bounces until it shoots out the way it came 
L-E,I learned that a solar eclipse occurs when the moon blocks the sun which casts a huge shadow over the earth 
L-E,A shadow is made by light hitting you and the light is big so it gets around the person and makes a shadow 
L-E,I also learned that there are things called atoms and electrons that can pass through wires and make electricity 
L-E,The northern lights happen when the sun makes tiny bits of electricity go down to earth 
L-E,If you look at a yellow flower the color that would absorb is blue and the colors that would bounce into your eyes are red and green 
L-E,If you look at a red rose blue and green are absorbed into your eyes and red is reflected 
L-E,When you see a rainbow  you only see half of it A rainbow is actual a circle but the clouds are blocking the half of the rainbow that you don't see 
L-E,If you look at a red rose in green light the rose doesn't absorb the green light so the rose appears black 
L-E,Fluorescence objects are glow in the dark objects A sea animal that lives under the water is glow in the dark and glow in the dark star stickers and bandages Fluorescence objects are made be friction like two rocks rubbing together 
L-E,A lunar eclipse is when the moon covers the sun Long time ago a man predicted that there would be a lunar eclipse and he was right 
L-E,A Solar eclipse is when the sun covers the moon 
L-E,My understanding about Shadows is that when light hits you it creates a shadow My theory is that the light hits you and goes around you to make a shadow Heres a picture to make it more simple 
L-E,Also they react like chemiluminescence witch is a process of changing chemic energy into light energy 
L-E,Solar panels absorb sun light rays and turn them into energy 
L-E,To reflect colors the object has to be the same color to reflect the light colorTo absorb light color the object has to be not the same color to be absorb 
L-E,I think that light travels in straight lines and some other people think that light travels in waves I also think that light is a wave but it travels in straight lines I think light travels in straight lines in two ways 
L-E,A rainbows are made by raindrops that act like a prism that make the rainbow 
L-E,If you look at a green apple for a long time the green cone gets tired but the red and blue are not tired and together red and blue make purple and purple is the opposite color of green 
L-E,Most things that glow have some fluorescent paint on them This paint absorbs light and then glows until it has no more light absorbed in it 
L-E,A shadow is made when darkness made when light shines on a opaque object  
L-E,A liner eclipse is when the earth is between the sun and the moon 
L-E,A solar eclipse is when the moon is between the sun and the earth 
L-E,A shadow is made when a light source hits an object 
L-E,A lunar eclipse is when the sun foe between the moon and casts a shadow 
L-E,A solar eclipse is when the sun goes in front of the moon 
L-E,I need to understand why you can get two different kinds of shadows one that is larger than you and one that is smaller than you my theory of what happens is that it appends on the time of day 
L-E,What helps things that glow are fluorescence pink and other colors 
L-E,If your body wants to see a red rose the red is bounced into your eyes and the other colors are absorbs 
L-E,If your body wants to see a yellow green and red is bounced into you eyes and the blue is absorbed 
L-E,Solar panels takes in light and makes it in to energy 
L-E,My understanding shadows starts at the shadow view if a light sours hits a optic nontransparent object which creates a shadow Such as a person is standing behind a light sours and a shadow papers behind them 
L-E,Rain can can be used as prisms thats why theres a rainbow after it rains 
L-E,A solar panel absorbs light and uses it as energy 
L-E,Fireflies produce light from their abdominals because of a chemical reaction caused by Lucifer and Lucifer This is called photoluminescence 
L-E,This is how a glow stick works When you snap a glow stick it makes a little hole and to chemicals collide and then they glow This is called chemiluminescence 
L-E,A shadow is made by standing in front of a light source and then the place you block up is where the shadow is made 
L-E,A solar eclipse is when the moon passes in between the sun and the earth causing a big shadow 
L-E,I thought glow in the dark could only happen with one thine but then I read Yasmin note and saw that it happens with three things heat friction and electricity 
L-E,In the shadows view I learned The closer the sun is to you the stronger it is 
L-E,Also I learned That your body blocked the sun and that creates a shadow The sun goes through the ground and makes a shadow for a root 
L-E,a rainbow in rain is made because its so damp outside 
L-E,We see a red rose because The primary colors go to the rose and green and blue get absorbed and red bounces off 
L-E,we see a yellow rose because all the secondary colors go at the rose the magenta and cyan gets absorbed but yellow bounces off 
L-E,A shadow is the darkness left behind when a light sours shines on a nontransparent object 
L-E,A solar eclipse is when the moon blocks the sun light from coming to the earth 
L-E,A lunar clips is when the sun blocks the moons light from going to earth 
L-E,You can make a rainbow with a prism by outing light thought a prism of rain Rain is what make the rainbow in the sky 
L-E,Solar panels are panels that use light to make electricity 
L-E,All we see is light Without light we can not see 
L-EE,We can see a yellow rose because red blue and green are going to the flower Red and green bounce into your eyes but blue absorbs 
L-EE,You can see a red rose because red bounces of and goes into your eyes blue and green get absorbed 
L-EE,When you see a red flower the red light bounces off the flower in to our eyes and the green blue gets absorbed 
L-EE,When you shine a light through a glass prism it ell make a rainbow on the surface it needs to be white light of the colors light wail be to strong and wont split up into the rainbow
L-EE,This is how absorbing and reflecting works the colors that make the object will be reflected and the leftover color will be wasted not used 
L-EE,A shadow is mad by an object in front of a light stream The light cant go around and then no light git be hind the objects and its dark 
L-EE,A solar eclipse is an eclipse of the sun It occurs when the moon is located between the sun and the earth The moon blocks the sunlight coming to the earth 
L-EE,My theory is that light travels in waves I leaned this by doing an ensnarement the end resale was a wave pattern Like doping to pebbles in a pond and the reason is like light 
L-EE,Most glowing things are painted with a layer of fluorescent paint this paint absorbs light and when it is dark the absorbed light would unleash the light that it saved until its empty and has no more light 
L-EE,but that doesn't explain why sometimes there are rainbows after rain storms or when it rains the answer to this is raindrops act as prisms but when I did a experiment at my house i filled a glass of water and turned out the lights I didn't see even a tiny outline of a rainbow 
L-EE,There are two types of eclipses The rift one is called a solar eclipse Its when the moon goes in front of the earth and behind the sun which casts a shadow upon earth As I said before an opaque object like the moon and the sun is the light source it makes a shadow 
L-EE,a lunar eclipse is the opiate of a solar eclipse a lunar eclipse is when the earth goes in front of the moon the earth is also opaque but the shadow this time is bigger 
L-EE,If light hits a red rose red gets reflected and blue and green get absorbed thats why we see red 
L-EE,but with a yellow rose green and red get reflected and blue gets absorbed because red and green make yellow 
L-EE,A lunar eclipse is when the moon over laps the sun and blackens out the sky so no one ca see the sun and the sun and the moon turn black 
L-EE,What is absorbing My understanding is that when white light hits a red object all the colors that make white  Red Green and Blue blue and green are reflected and red is absorbed 
L-EE,What is Reflecting My understanding is like before we have a red dress when white light hits the red dress blue and green are reflected and red is absorbed Why I think there reflected is because its not the same color 
L-EE,this is how we can see a red rose white light hits the rose red is reflected and blue and green are absorbed and the rose papers upside down and back wards but your brain turns it to the right way 
L-EE,this is how we see a yellow rose the white light hits the rose green and red are reflected and blue is absorbed why green and red are reflected incited of just one color is because yellow is a secondary color and are brain sees the rose upside down and backwards 
L-EE,New information A lunar eclipse is when the earth is between the sun and the moon Since the earth is in front of the moon it castes a shadow over the moon making it in total darkness 
L-EE,A solar eclipse is when the moon casts a show over the earth and its just like a lunar eclipse precept what I just told you 
L-EE,The way we see a red rose is that white light contains the primary coleus of light red blue and green What happens is that the red light hitting a red rose the red light bounces off and into our eyes and the other colors get absorbed 
L-EE,With a yellow ors its pretty much the same thing but 2 colors don't get absorbed they mix and bounce off as one ray 
L-EE,The northern lights are cosed by partials from the sun The particles are so small you couldn't see them How they acute is when the particles hit highest thing of the earths atmosphere they electrify the air making it glow 
L-EE,Diffused reflection is when a ray of light comes and hits something like bumpy tinfoil The light comes and egos everywhere because it has more than one thing to bounce off of it It egos up down right left because when its bumpy it goes like that because of different bumps 
L-EE,Convex mirrors are used in stores They let you see around corners and stuff ltd shaped like a ball with the top cut off the way it lets you see around corners is it does everything but catch light so it bounces off as an angle 
L-EE,All we see is light the way I can prove it is that the same color light bounces off things that are supposed to be that color Then the color bounces into your eye Three primary colors are in white light so if you mix those you'll get any color 
L-EE,I just learned that a lunar eclipse occurs when the earth is between the sun and the moon The earth is in front of the moon and behind the sun which makes a huge shadow over the moon 
L-EE,This is how rainbows are made with rain The sky is still moist and there are drops in the air which can be used like prisms so if the left over raindrops can be used like prisms then the light can shine through it to make a rainbow 
L-EE,Here is how solar panels work Dull dark surfaces do not reflect much light The dark surfaces absorb the suns rays and turn the rays into thermal energy The thermal energy is turned into heated water and then it is pumped into a storage tank and goes out through a fan That means that black attracts heat 
L-EE,I think light travels in a straight line because the shadows prove that they travel straight or else the shadows would be wobbly 
L-EE,this is my picture of a light bulb a light bulb is made out of glass and artificial light The glass is to couscous the light to the spot you would like it and the artificial light is from the energy in the air that comes from your wall When you plug in a light a computer or anything that has a plug the energy goad through whores that travel over our hes and under us These 2 things are all plugd into a wall 
L-EE,The picture I drew was making a rainbow out of a prism This picture is with two prisms this is how it works If you shine a light on a prism a rainbow will appear but if you put another prism in front of the other prism the light will turn white again This is How to make white light through a viable spectrum 
L-EE,If you look at a red rose in magenta light the magenta light red and blue hits the red surface The color red is reflected But the color blue is absorbed then the rose appears red 
L-EE,A solar eclipse is an eclipse of the sun It occurs when the moon is located between the sun and the earth The moon blocks the sunlight coming to the earth 
L-EE,My understanding about a Lunar eclipse is that when the Earth is between the Sun and the Moon The Sun casts a shadow over the moon called a lunar eclipse 
L-EE,My theory's that light travels in a wave line because if you drive behind a bus you'll see heat that looks wave 
L-EE,Shadows A shadow is an inexact reflection of your body that shows on a very sunny day when you are outside You see your shadow when you happen to be outside and you look down at the ground Also your shadow touches you wherever you touch the ground 
L-EE,Also you can see a green object because white light shines on that object white light has red orange yellow green blue indigo and violet in it and the object absorbs all the colors except green which is reflected into the eyes of the person that is looking at the object 
L-EE,We see a red rose when there is a flashlight or another light source that will shine on the rose and absorb the green and blue light and reflect the red light into our eyes 
L-EE,and how we see a yellow rose is that it is the same but the red and green light are reflected and blue is absorbed 
L-EE,How do you make a rainbow with rain The sky is still wet with raindrops and the sunlight shines through the drops and a rainbow forms in the sky Make a rainbow with a prism exactly the same way 
L-EE,The northern lights are also called the aurora Borealis and they are lights in the sky that are mixtures of colors that are seen only in the northern parts of the world and that is why they are called the northern lights 
L-EE,The law of reflection on a flat mirror is when the incident ray goes on the mirror and makes the angle of incidence There is an invisible line between the angle and ray of incidence and the angle and ray of reflection The reflection ray is the reflection of the incident ray 
L-EE,The Northern Lights are ribbons of red pink and ghostly green lights that dance and shimmer for hours across the sky They occur when the sun bombards earth with tiny particles of electricity too small for us to see When these particles hit the highest part of the earths atmosphere they electrify the air and make it glow 
L-EE,Why are Northern Lights different colors Each gas in earths atmosphere glows with its own color when it becomes charged with electricity Oxygen gives off an eerie green glow nitrogen glows red and neon gas turns pink 
L-EE,My theory's that light travels in waves because when we did an experiment with progesterone and a tennis ball hanging from the vealing on a piece of string And when we shone light on it the tennis balls shader was clear But the strings shadow had some light on it 
L-EE,Dull dark surfaces do not reflect much light so they are perfect for solar panels instead they absorb the suns rays and turn them into thermal energy this means that on a roof there are dark hoses of water  The water heats up because the hoses are absorbing the suns rays and they are isolated The heated water is pumped into a storage tank where it used to heat the house  
L-EE,I also learned that a solar eclipse happens when the moon blocks the sun which makes a large shadow over the earth That is why when your outside and the sun dispersals its just a large shadow 
L-EE,I also learned that a lunar eclipse is caused when the earth is between the sun and the moon 
L-EE,Also if your looking at a yellow flower the blue light would be absorbed allowing the two other colors to both making yellow would bounce of into your two sensitive cone to those colors 
L-EE,The Northern lights are caused by the sun bombarding the earth with tiny partials of electricity When these partials hit the highest part of the hates atmosphere it electrolysis the air and makes it glow 
L-EE,To make a rainbow with rain it in voles moisture in the air and since there is moisture in the air the moistness acts like a prism 
L-EE,When looking at a red rose you need light right You do so when your looking at that objetc the light shines on it and since it is red it refletcs the red light off the objetc and all the other colors get absorbed Its the same with any other color including yellow green etc 
L-EE,A lunar eclipse is when the earth is right in between the sun and the moon winch casts a shadow over the moon making the moon total darkness 
L-EE,Solar panels are used for sucking up sunlight and using the sunlight for something such as a solar powered windmill That works by the sunlight getting sucked into a solar panel and the light moves the windmill 
L-EE,A red rose looks red because the red light in the white light reflects of the rose and in to your eyes the blue and green light gets absorbed 
L-EE,A yellow flower looks yellow because the red and the green light in the white light are reflexed in to you eyes and the blue is absorbed 
L-EE,Shadow darkness made when light shines on an opaque nontransparent object If the light shines on an opaque object it is imposable for the shadow to be on the same side the light is coming from unless there is a mirror If there is no light there isn't a shadow So there is a shadow where the light cant reach 
L-EE,A lunar eclipse is when the earth is between the sun and the moon and it casts a shadow over the moon 
L-EE,Inside luminous objects or animals some form of energy changes into light energy This energy usually changes into chemical electrical thermal and nuclear energy The process of giving off light is called incandescence 
L-EE,You have three eye cones in your eyes One is sensitive to red one is sensitive to blue and one is sensitive to green so when you see something blue the blue eye cone starts getting sensitive so you can see the color 
L-EE,When we look at a red rose the red eye cone color bounces off into our eye and the other two colors absorb so you see the color of the rose 
L-EE,When we had the class debate I was the only student who was not on a side because my theory was light travels in waves but the waves go in a strait line and the debate was between straight line and waves And now we have lots of ideas from the debate and we don't know which one is right now is light travels sort of like this Light travels in a straight line but appears to be wavy or light travels in waves but appears to be straight That means that light has aspects of both straight lines and waves It depends on how you look at it Or what your experiment is trying to prove In our class we have seen experiments that prove both that light travels in straight lines box with powder and shadow experiments and wavy lines Thomas Young experiment 
L-EE,My understanding of Light The colors of light Light is made up of many many different colors You cannot see those colors because those colors mixed together to get white light White light is transparent so you cant see it 
L-EE,When it rains the raindrops split the light so you can see 7 discolored orange yellow green blue indigo and violet that make a rainbow 
L-EE,The way you see what color everything is is because of light hitting your eye when their is a green leaf the light hits it before it splits up it is called white light the green leaf absorbs the other colors but the green keeps going because it is the same color The green light keeps going until it goes into your eye Then the brain identifies what color and it is 
L-EE,Cones tire easily If you were looking at a green apple the cone that responds to green light gets tired So when you look at a piece of white paper the green cone would be to tired but the red and blue wouldn't and red and blue make purple And purple is the opposite of green on the color wheel 
L-EE,This is why the colors of the rainbow are in the same order As you know there are seven colors that we know of They all travel at a the same wave frequency and they get mixed But when light goes through something like rain the frequency of the light waves get differed For some reason red always has the longest frequency and purple has the shortest 
L-EE,That is why when you look at a yellow thing the red and green light bounce of it but blue gets absorbs mixes and comes to your eye as yellow 
L-EE,"if worms have eyes my  theory is that they don't because 1 if they did the soil would get into their eyes unless their eyes had see through membranes on them to stop that but that would be to complex for worms
The second reason is that worms are too primitive to have  eyes
Thats why I think that they have a special sense that tells the worms if its light or dark through the heat when its light outside they feel heat and when its dark its cold
  "
L-EE,worms don't have eyes because they have photo receptors we have those in our spectrophotometers sense the light so the worms can move The light patterns show the worms where to go Heat is in the light and the photo receptors also help them to sense heat 
L-EE,is when you put litter in the compost bin you are littering because things in the compost get put in the soil so if you put your candy wrapper that came from the house down the street last Halloween the wrapper will get put in the soil and there it will stay you probably do not care cause your probably enjoying the candy cause compost is banana peels or apple cores that have the left over nutrients in it that go in the soil also they do not hire people to sort through the compost so maybe you should read the sign that goes over the bin saying  COMPOST recycling AND LITTER and after you eat an apple core it can be used in a different way   
L-E,is that rocks get chopped up by feet and other rocks which are rolled over to the other rocks  over time they are chopped into smaller pieces of rock And that repeats until they are tiny pieces Then it rains which makes it nice and moist Then the sun dries it up a little bit You do not want it too dry Then it needs a little air Worms fertilize it And now we have soil soil does not come from any particular place 
L-E,is that soil is made out of rocks that get turned into sand then you maybe take a little bit of grounded up wood You take a little water then a little sunshine and there is your soil   
L-E,is because we have a sense of up and down worms have a sense of light and dark Like when we have been in the dark for a long time when you come out even when your eyes are closed you can still feel the light 
L-E,is that it is rolled over and crushed rock and it needs compost to stay healthy because the compost dissolves and its nutrients does not so it goes in the soil 
L-E,"is that worms have a six sense which is electro
charge sensory This specific sense is the same one that Platypus use to catch its food The way this sense works is every single object on earth has electro charges bouncing off it so when the worm comes it feels the charges so it does not bump into it Since there are so many roots underground this sense comes in handy under there Only certain animals have a six sense like Platypus Worms and many more animals have a six sense  "
L-EE,is that Algae isn't exactly Fungi because Algae is a under water Aqua plant And Fungi is known not to be a plant but to be something completely different It has its own kingdom In fact Fungi id closer to a animal then a plant I think that Algae is NOT connected to fungi but is connected to plants my theory is that there are different kinds of under water Fungi and maybe Algae is connected to THAT type of Fungi truly E 
L-EE,is that fungus feeds the trees that DO Give us air and in that way it helps us have oxygen and air And that relates to how we breath out Carbondale and the trees need that to make air for us and  we keep the trees doing that process and the routine that helps us live So thats like we are trees to them because we give them their air and they give us our air by their air that we give them 
L-EE,A thing that involves color and is very magnificent is the northern lights This happens because of magnetic disturbances of the sun The sun sends out particles of electricity that are microscopic The earths atmosphere makes the air electrified and then it glow The colors that glow are red pink and green 
L-EE,There are also things called solar panels They are made to catch light The light that they catch is used to make electricity Solar panels probably have a lot of tubes connected 
L-EE,A shadow is the darkness on the other side of an opaque object whits is nontransparent When a light shines on an opaque object the light cant get around it so there is only darkness whits is a shadow 
L-EE,A lunate eclipse is when the art goes between the moon and the sun The sun hits the eart and the eart casts a shadow on the moon winch give the moon total darkness 
L-EE,A solar eclipse is when the moon is in the middle and blocks the light from hitting the earth making that side dark 
L-EE,1 How do you think light travels My theory is that since light doesn't travel on anything it has to make enough energy to keep going My theory is that there are little wavelets of energy that travel inside bigger straight lines Like a flashlight That also explains why light is hot 
L-EE,People make shadows by just standing in the light Because light travels in a titrate line or Waveland it hits a portion or thing and the blocks the light so it cant reach the ground and thee for makes an outline of that object 
L-EE,Shadow My theory is that all the light gets around but it doesn't get past your body so it is dark and the shape of your body 
L-EE,A lunar eclipse is when the earth is between the sun and the moon and it casts a shadow over the moon 
L-EE,A solar eclipse it happens when the moon is located between the sun and the earth and the moon blocks the sunlight 
L-EE,Solar energy Solar panels are dark so they attract heat and the sun is turned into thermal energy In the panels there are little tubes and the water gets warmer the warm water is pumped into a storage tank and it heats the house 
L-EE,The Northern lights are red pink ghostly greens the Northern lights happen when the sun bombards earth with particles that are electric When they hit the highest part of the earths atmosphere they electrify the air and it glows 
L-EE,A lunar eclipse is when the earth is between the moon and the sun in which the sun shines on earth and makes a shadow on the moon which makes the moon in total darkness 
L-EE,If a white light is shined on a red flower the green and blue is absorbed and the red is reflected that is how we see a red flower 
L-E,"Comets, trans-Neptunian objects, or water-rich meteoroids callled protoplanetsfrom the outer reaches of the asteroid belt colliding with Earthmay have brought water to the world's oceans."
L-E,I think what would happen is it could/would dmage your teeth and youcould get diabetes like Erica said. You may not be able to survive. It may be like drinking saltwater instead of regular water. You can't survive if you just drink saltwater.
L-E,Africa's water dries up more quickly because they are closer to the equator.
L-E,[ - is there might have been nutrients on the bery so that must be why- ]
L-E,Inoticed that after the leaves change color the enregy is no longer getting produced so that could be a reason they fall off.
L-E,It might be because they don't have the resources.
L-E,"I think it's because there is not a lot of bodies of water,and they have a lot of 3rd world countries that can not afford wells."
L-E,I have a new theroy about how ants build their houses. I think they could possibaly push sand/mud/dirt to were they want the anthills.
L-E,[ - is that I usually see moss on the dark areas of trees. So I am thinking it forms on dark areas. I also think it forms when its dewy and wet.- ]
L-E,I noticed that maybe only some trees have moss growing to the north maybe like a compass moss will grow to the north because there is something there what is that something
L-E,[ - is that they are poisonis because they eat stuff that makes them poison is- ]
L-E,[ - is that a bird or animal flys over and drops it into the courtyard and then lays eggs that make more spider which make more and more and more until they go exsticked or the eco system dies.- ]
L-E,"Some flowers are very sweet-smelling, and they originally grew thorns to protect themselves from animals that may try to eat them. So my theory is that they they may have been for protection, like you said."
L-E,"there are diffrent types of moss such asiron moss wich will only grow on thigs with heavy amounts of iron on it[ - is that the moss only sticks to certain things- ]your friend Sienna (:"
L-E,"I learned tha there are over 12,000 types of ants. Also they are soical insects witch mean they move in larage groups."
L-E,"no, because metal is not madde out of anything living."
L-E,"Serena:an egg is clear then it turns white when it is older then the baby is clear and gets its coloRS when it's olderCamryn a baby is clear till it gets older than they turn a dark brown"
L-E,[ - is I know that moss has very tiny thin roots I think because when i pick up moss I can't even see the roots of the moss- ]
L-E,[ - if you need any ideas dont water the ants. Ants could die if waters hits ants. build just a few ant hills. Because thousands of ants live in one ant hill
L-E,if an ant eats the right kind of food it can become a queen ant!
L-E,[ - All ants have different jobs.As they grow they get darker.Ants go faster since they have tiny legs.there can be a thousands of ants in a anthill. If a ant get feed the right things they can be a queen.- ]
L-E,"[ - is that an Anthill is prepared by worker ants that are strong. (Like not ants that are just born)- ][ - Is that the Queen ant could get a part of a different colony who the queen says in Ant Language could say ""Build me an Anthill!""]"
L-E,[ - is that they go down deep so preditors will not eat them- ]
L-E,"Maybe The Ant That Eats the right food will not be the king because it dosen't lay babies.But it can lead the other ants to find another group with a queen!"
L-E,"[ - is over time, I think that the stem of the apple gets weaker and weaker, and sometimes the wind might blow the apple off the tree and probably some animals nock them off too.- ]"
L-E,flamingos are born gray but they eat a type of plant and a type of mineral in the plant turns the flamigo pink. it should be the same with ants
L-E,"If baby ants eat the right food they can turn into the queen."
L-E,[ - You can tell how old a tree is if you cut it open a bit you see circles 1 circle for every year- ]
L-E,another reason why living things need energy is because if you don‚t eat you can starve and cannot live
L-E,Apples fall because of gravity. The apple falls when it gets ripe. Once it is ripe it gets weak around the stem and the gravity pulls it down to the ground
L-E,In the daytime the hot air comes from the river and than it goes up in the air and than the cold air replaces it. In the courtyard when its about to be winter the nights are cold but in the summer the nights are worm by the ways the air cycle in the daytie is the opposite of the air cycle in the nightime.
L-E,"Toads can burrow if there is a predotor or a emergency, maybe thats where toads go when its winter, under ground."
L-E,"[ - Is if a venomous or poisonous animal eats another venomous or poisonous animal, some will survive, and some will maybe die. some animals eat venomous or poisonous animal as a food sourse, but maybe another animal can't survive it.- ]"
L-E,"[ - Peat is formed by decaying moss and plants. This is important because peat is a fuel. It can be used for fertilizer, burn for fuel, and eventually, it becomes coal.- ]"

L-E,"[ - I learned is that abiotic means decomposition by a chemical process, and that biotic means decomposition of living orgonisms.- ]"
L-E,some countries don't have the water they need because the dont have the equipment to filter and distribute it to more people.
L-E,some countries also don't have much water because of a drout or of a water shortage from a war or hot weather.
L-E,They should filter the water if its dirty so it's healthy or add pipes around so it's not as hard to get water
L-E,"I know that the earth will always have about the same amount of water, But we can make water dirty so we can't use it again until we purify it. In Africa one of the main water sources is lake chad, but it has been shrinking. here is a link to a picture of lake chads water supply.https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_kg6WlPN_ueP2yRuoBxnZLFXPB07KR4BgQ4Fs8icgcU/edit (Link->https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_kg6WlPN_ueP2yRuoBxnZLFXPB07KR4BgQ4Fs8icgcU/edit)"
L-E,"If we put 2/3 hydrogen and 1/3 oxygen in a container, then we might turn out with water. If we can get a big chunk of a glacier, then we can melt it and give more water to countries in need."
L-E,"Water scarcity has been happening in the book "" long walk to water"", because in 2008 Nyla has to walk the whole morning to get water."
L-E,"One way to get fresh water is to melt glaciers into water. I know this because if you melt snow or ice, it becomes water."
L-E,"[ - I know that people need clean water in order to stay nice and healthy. Otherwise, if people drink dirty water, people is going to be sick or pass away.- ]"
L-E,"The fruit would need water,I think it would have water in it,and if it has added sugar or sweetner that would need water to,so I don't think so. Plus water is better for you."
L-E,No because water does not carry sugar. Juice carry's a ton of sugar and its not that healthy.
L-E,The reason why we need water is because we wont be able to servive. Water is more important than food because food just helps your stomach. Water keeps you alive and water keeps all the animals and plants alive too.
L-E,"Water is much more healthier than soda. I know this because soda has a lot of sugar in it, But water doesn't have sugar."
L-E,Many people cannot get to water because of water scarcity. I think water scarcity is when people can't get water. I think that also most people don't know how to get water because they don't have the proper education. Like how Nya didn't know how to get water from under the ground because she did not know.
L-E,[ - is that there is oil on the poison ivy that makes you ich and there is alot of diffrent ways it can get in any were at any time at any place .- ]
L-E,[ -Moss does not only grow on the north side of trees. Moss grows on the north side of trees if the tree lives in the northern hemisphere. the reason for this because the sun hits the north side of trees so water evaporates. So moss grows. if the tree lives in the southern hemisphere. it grows on the south side. - ]
L-E,the female moquitos spit on your skin to num up your skin were it smells/looks sweeet and suger filled and then they put their sharp nose in your skin and find a blood vesel and suck out your blood.
L-E,[ - I think ant hills are living because the are in are ecosystem and they are ecsposed to air to live- ]
L-E,[ - Is that air works to clean up are ecostyem by blowing dead leaves away or to barry it - ]
L-E,"[ - is if you crush a seed and give it water, soil and sun it will grow- ]"
L-E,Maybe small animals like ants for a nest or a birdwhen the moss is on the tree the bird might use it for it's nest.
L-E,[ - is that the moss might have got stuck on the brick somehow and there might have some water on it that might keep it sticking if you look in google how it gets stuck on the brick and gets nutrients from it might help - ]
L-E,"Most likely, it would not grow. Just because that the roots are what START the process for the tree to grow.[ - mostly, is that the tree will not grow anymore, but will still live... Unless you cut it or it falls.- ]"
L-E,[ - is that maybe the berries are a source of food to the stink bugs and that's why they were all over the berries.- ]
L-E,My theroy is that white soil interacts with the plants the same as brown/regular does because I have observed NO CHANGE between either white soil or regular/brown soil. My hypothisis is that they are just diffrent colors and I do not think that that change makes a diffrence of how they grow.
L-E,"what evidence do we have to prove why we need air and why fish don't.Fish might have some kind part in their body to help them survive in water with no air.It might be the gills or maybe their heart has some kind of organ that gives them air"
L-E,"My theory is you can feel the sun on you even if it_ far away because the rays give off a whole lot of energy, the sun reflects on a cloud and a cloud shoots to the ground like a mirror"
L-E,"Again I didnt say that humans should start making water. and ocean water has salt in it if we drink too much humans will die. thats what some people are trying to figure out, how to get salt out of the salt water. but your obviously not listening.(I know google dosnt know everything I said find a website)"
L-E,"1.usually trees i see outside are like picture one.iwent outside and saw different tree that looked like picture two2.old trees have different barks may be because when they get old they have wrikles like old people's skin. young trees have no wrinkles like young people."
L-E,[ - my theory is that ants find the hills and just put hole and the top the dont build the hills- ]
L-E,[ - it is probably damp there to because it is dark and that stops the sun from drying it so maybe it grows in dark and damp places - ]
L-E,"i predict that the moss on the ground will keep growing if it gets water and sun or else it will die .[ - is that the cold weather and the rain will keep it alive . Or the rain will sit there and the cold will freeze it- ]"
L-E,The freezing and cold tempretures will kill the moss. and the rain will help it grow.
L-E,I can add on to that because when weather puts the pressure on the matter it can make it transfer into a different shape or fall apart like if there was a Tsunami the waves are so strong that they can make houses and buildings fall apart and it can squish cars and make them flat or put them into a different shape or like when you pour water into a cup it takes the form of the cup.
L-E,"I also think that the moss grows to the north, because the north is colder and moss usually grows in cool and wet conditions."
L-E,"I was wondering in the winter when tree leafs change color and fall I was wondering if poison ivy did that too.Because poison ivy is A leaf as well but maybe the poison in the poison ivy makes it stay alive in the winter but I'm not so sure"
L-E,In Photosynethesis the plant will use energy from the sunlight to convert carbon dioxide from the atmosphere into simple sugars. A plant needs water and sunlight for food.
L-E,[ - of why the stinkbugs are not moving when they are on the berries is maybe they want it as their source of food and the stinkbugs don't want the other stinkbugs getting over the berries. Also maybe since it's getting colder the stinkbugs want to get as much food as they can because it will be a lot colder and the stinkbugs will lose their sources of food.- ]
L-E,Some caterpillars like monarchs eat milkweed leaves so that they can scare there predators off and so they dont get eaten
L-E,the bettle has a brown side for camiflouge and the green side is for that if camiflouge fails it can turn around to show the brigh green side to try to scare away the preadator
L-E,"I think that the weather is making the apples fall down beacause the wind is putting preser on the apple.[ - is that when the apples fall down they rot because they don't get the nuterents they need- ][ - that the applesare like people if the don't get there nutrents they get sick.- ]"
L-E,"I Can Add On To That Beacuse When The Weather Is Putting The Pressure On To The Apple And Making It Fall Off The Tree Its Like When Someone Were To Push You Off The Edge Of A Pool, The Pressure Of The Person Pushing You Is Putting Impact On Your Boby And Therefore Making You Fall Into The Pool. Also I Agree With You Saying That If A Person Were Sick Its Like An Apple Slowly Rotting Because It Dosn't Have The Nutrients To Grow Off Of."
L-E,first apple trees need sun light to grow and the rain then it keeps growing and growing untill it becomes a big apple tree with tasty apples on it
L-E,when they fall of the tree than they cant grow any more like a human when a human eats and than grows and you grow till you cant grow any more than advetually die so thats the same with apples
L-E,"The apple rots because the enrgery from the tree put it into the apple when it was on the tree and when said apple fell off of the tree,it didn't get any more ""food"" from the tree so it will rot and die then posibly get eaten."
L-E,When the apple falls from the tree it gets a bruise then the decomposers build o to the bruise and takes the energy from the apple then the apple rots
L-E,it interacts with humans because if it is contagous than it can spred around if you tuch it.
L-E,I think once the ivy interacts with the skin it will infect the outside layer of skin and the Interaction will cause an infection from bolth the ivy and the skin and that will create the rash. :)

L-E,"[ - Seeds are living matter.Because Seeds in apples are like unborn children they dont grow but when they get the right treatment they grow into a huge apple tree.- ]"
L-E,Moss will grow better in damper places because it takes in all the water in the air.
L-E,"Poison in poison ivy, poison oak, and poison sumac is called urushiol and it is used to protect the plant. NEVER burn the plant, because if the urushiol gets in the air and you breathe it in, it will most likely kill you."
L-E,They give plants energy and animals eat that plant so they get energy and so on.
L-E,[ - Moss grows on the north side of trees because water evaporates on the north side of the tree.In the southern hemisphere water evaporates on the south side of trees.- ]
L-E,energy can come from the sun and fossil fules and the suns energy is the main source of life like the plants convert it into food for them. and then an anamail comes along and eats the plant and absobs the energy.
L-E,"I think that there is nutrients in thing animals eat that give them energy, if they can't get energy they might be a canirvor if it's a plant because they can't convert those nutrients"
L-E,the energy is still being produced because if it stoped the tree would die. the leaves are probably are getting weak and dry because the cold.
L-E,"[ - is that maybe plants make food. The roots also need air so they can get nutrients and Plants need air. They use the carbon dioxide in the air for water because there is 1% of water in air. It is called photosynthesis. (some info from google.)- ]"
L-E,[ - is that if moss dies out then it will create a problem wave in the ecosydom many animals will die and plants will to because it provides water on those hot days when there is no water- ]
L-E,"[ - The sun provides humankind with light and heat to create new earth habitate. It also provides plants to grow to help the food chain. Sunlight also helps with weather, which weather helps ecosystems too. Sunlight can cause droughts when there is less rain and intense rain.- ]"

Shown a diagram of different parts of the tounge and have to put the dipped in Q-tip on the part.You have to log it on a paper if you can taste it or not. In the end we shared our results and made a conclusion that the tounge is not made up of seperterate taste buds which means that not all article/videos aren‚t always true. - ]"
L-EE,I used to think that the air moves by itself now I know that the sun makes the air move and that the sun has to be in a certain area to push the wind it's the low pressure system as the warm air rises it cools of and eventually sinks back down the system is like a big engine taking in air all around it. That gets you a lot of moving air
L-EE,"I used to think that not alot of insects can live in moss because moss insects are pretty big like a big ant, but thereês a insect called a tardigrade, a tardigrade is a insect that lives in or around moss, so if a tardigrade can live in moss, that mean other insects can live or can they because a tardigrade is microscopic so thereês a lot of space for the tardigrade, now i think that moss canêt really provide a home or insects because a ant lives underground, so if ants lives on moss, when it rain the rain will wash the ants away."
L-EE,"Mosquitoes are part of the food web is because they get eaten by spiders,dragon flies and more. they are cosumers because they eat plants and obsorb the energy.But they get eaten by the animals thet I mentioned."
L-EE,"Like I said already in ""More about Moss"".Moss may grow only on a north side of a tree if that's the shadiest location as the sun tracks the sky. If there is something else providing shade (or moisture), the moss will grow in those places just as well."
L-EE,"[ - bryophytes are actually a seedless plants. they do not need seed pollenaters or photosynthesis to grow. moss, liverworts and hornworts or all types of seedless plants. usally they live in wet and dewy habitats. this is how they grow.: A moss gives out seeds called spores that travel inair and lands onsome surface. the seed that lands on a surface will soon grow into a moss.- ]"
L-EE,"wait hailey I think you are right but the spores are not only for the wind they are also for the moss to grow let me explain it to you:As part of the first plant family to colonize Earth, the soft beds of mosses that now grace mountain streams and woodlands may have shaped our planetês history.Primitive mosses, similar to the hundreds of moss species found in Appalachia, might have triggered two cool periods around 455 million years ago, according to a recent study. Published earlier this year in Nature Geoscience, the study suggests that early mosses clinging to prehistoric rocks sped up the weathering of certain minerals from those rocks. The release of these minerals accelerated the pace of carbon sequestration, leading to cooler temperatures that paved the way for further plant and animal evolution."
L-EE,"All birds have feathers for different reasons. like the penguins have feathers to keep warm,chickens have feathers because they also need to keep warm, they also need them to flutter up to places only a few feet above the ground, turkeys need feathers also to flutter up to places and to keep warm. and penguins have a thick layer of blubber under their feathers to keep warm in the extreme cold"
L-EE,"I,ve Learned That All Living Things Are Linked Together By What They Eat. For Example, Say If There Were No More Shrimp The Amount Animals That Eat The Shrimp Will Start To Decrease And It Would Just Keep On Decreasing. Also Did You Know That The Food Web Can Contain Lost And Lots Of Animals In It? The Food Web Has Three Main Elements. Producers, Consumers, And Decomposers. Producers Are Plants, They Make Their Own Food Out Of The Sun, (Also Known As Photosynthasis.) The Producers Are Mostly At The Bottom Of The Food Chain. Consumers Can't Make Their Own Food So They Eat The Producers. Primary Consumers Are Herbavors, Secondary Consumers Are Carnivors, And Some Consumers Are Omnivors. (Also There Are Parasite Cosumers!) Decomposers Are Mostly Bacteria. They Help To Brake Down Dead Animals Or Dead Plants Or Any Of Those Dead Things."

L-EE,I learned that at first I thought that moss did not have any roots but now I found out that moss actually moss has tiny small roots and that moss is eukaryotic meaning their cells have nucleus that also contain cell wall called cellulose there also autotrophic which means they make their own food they also carry a photosynthesis witch makes carbon carbon dioxide into sugar. In order for moss to grow in other places there has to be other moss to send around spores. If it lands somewhere with the right temperature than it can grow correctly seedless plants are separated into different groups Vascular and nonvascular vascular have canals that carry water throughout their body. Nonvascular plants or bryophytes instead of collecting water from there roots they collect water though there thin cell walls they donêt grow more than a few centimeters tall. Thin rootlike rhizoids holds the plants down and also absorb water from the ground. You will find bryophytes all around the world mostly in rain forests and ponds and streams. Mosses are the most common bryophytes clumped in layers on tree trunks the ground or even rocks. Moss and liverworts were the first plants to live harsh places.
L-EE,"Not all plants have flowers or seeds. Ferns and mosses are plants, but they produce spores. Fungi or mushrooms also make spores, but they are not plants. Spores on ferns develop under the leaves. They look like brown spots, but you will need a microscope to see them. Each type of fern has spores of a different shape. Some plants reproduce without seeds or spores in a kind of cloning. Cutting, grafting, or bulbs can be used to grow new plants."
L-EE,"so what i learned is that photosnthesis is light tht comes from the sun and rain water and then it mixes it to gether and then creates this suger. but its not the suger thats in coockies, its a natrule suger. ill post a pickture about it."
L-EE,"Photosynthiesis is where a plant turns energy from the sun into glucose for food. Meanwhile the roots suck up water and take in carbon dioxide, andreleases air as a waste product."
L-EE,"Photosynthesis occurs when a plant soaks up water through its roots, absorbs carbon dioxide (Co2) through openings in the leaves called stomata, and stores energy from sunlight as chemical energy. The water travels up the plant's stem through a transport tissue calledxylem. The water and Co2 spread through the leaves into cells calledthe palisades and the spongy cells. The cells are filled with structures called chloroplasts, which contain a green pigment called chlorophyll. Chlorophyll splits the water into molecules of hydrogen and oxygen atoms. The sunlight chemical energy is used to create glucose from the hydrogen and carbon dioxide. The glucose dissolves into extra water molecules, and gives the plant an extra boost of energy that it needs to grow. The plant gives off the oxygen atoms as a waste product."
L-EE,"the food chain of the ants start with ants getting birth,then they eat ,then the chimpanzees eat the ants with their tools like sticks.then here comes a big predator called a jaguar then it eats the chimpanzee then here comes the the humans in africa eat the jaguar and leave it on the ground then it decomposes then it goes all over again"
L-EE,"[ - Decomposition works when organic substances break down non-living, more simple organic matter (foxes, deers, etc.). This process helps ecosystems by turning organic matter into enerygy for other plants to grow in (Soil). Fungi, bacteria and insects are the ones who do this process, they're called decomposers.- ]"
L-EE,"The Blade, orlamina, is the broad, flat part of the leaf. Photosynthesis occurs in the blade, which has many green food-making cells. Leaf blades differ from one another in several ways: (1) the types of edges, (2) the patterns of the veins, and (3) the number of blades per leaf.The Types of Edges.Almost all narrow, grasslike leaves and needles leaves have a blade with a smooth edge, as do many broadleaf plants, particularly those that are native to warm climates. The rubber plant, a common house plant, is a good example of such a plant.The leaves of many temperate broadleaf plants have small, jagged points called teeth along the blade edge. Birch and elm trees have such leaves. Some plants havehydathodes, tiny valvelike structures that can release excess water from the leaf. The teeth of young leaves on many plants, including cottonwood and pin cherry trees, bear tiny glads. These glands produce liquids that protect the young leaf from plant-eating insects.Some temperate broadleaf plants -- including sassafras trees and certain mulberry and oak trees -- have lobed leaves. The edge of such a leaf looks as if large bites have been taken out of it. This lobing helps heat escape from the leaf."
L-EE,"Wolves don't have alot of predtors as you would think they do because wolves are usally in packs. Wolves eat most of the following animals. Elk, Ox, Rabbit, Moose, Beavers, Fish, Musk, and many more. The predtors of the wolves are bear and mountian lion. That's common predtors for the wolves"
L-EE,When the apples fall they interact with the air because the apple is falling through the air.when it falls to the ground it is interacting with leaves. Over time the apple will interact with decomposers. The decomposers interact with the apple by eating it so it get rotten.
L-EE,"decompoition is in the naturle process by which large organic materials and molecules are broken down into simpler ones.The ultimante products of decompoition are simple molecules such as carbon dioxid water. decompoition is actually an extremly vital ecological process."
L-EE,"Photosynthesis starts off with the sun. When the sun is not blocked the sunlight goes to plants and gives the plants energy. notes:plants make carbon dioxide into sugar from sunlight, plants use stuff like air, H2O, Carbon dioxide, and sunlight to make there own food. When plans make there own food and ""eat"" it, they release water."
L-EE,"Pollution In The WaterThe main sources of water pollution are, Discharge of untreated Raw Sewage from households and factories, Chemicals dumped from Factories, Human littering in rivers, oceans, lakes and other bodies of water. The Great Pacific Garbage Patch is one of the main sources of pollution in the water. It is known for its many garbage and plastic.Every day approximately 8 million pieces of plastic pollution find their way into our oceans. There may now be around 5.25 trillion macro and microplastic pieces floating in the open ocean. Weighing up to 269,000 tons. In developing countries, 70 percent of industrial wastes are dumped untreated into waters, polluting the usable water supply. Polluted water can cause serious diseases some of these water-borne diseases are Typhoid, Cholera, Paratyphoid Fever, Dysentery, Jaundice, Amoebiasis and Malaria. Chemicals in the water also have negative effects on our health. Pesticides _ can damage the nervous system and cause cancer because of the carbonates and organophosphates that they contain.Each year 1.2 trillion gallons of untreated sewage, stormwater, and industrial waste are dumped into US water. While children make up 10% of the world's population, over 40% of the global burden of disease falls on them. More than 3 million children under age five die annually from environmental factors.–Approximately 40% of the lakes in America are too polluted for fishing, aquatic life, or swimming.” –Each year 1.2 trillion gallons of untreated sewage, stormwater, and industrial waste are dumped into US water.” Eighty percent of pollution to the marine environment comes from the land."
L-EE,"The biggest plants on the planet, trees offer shade and wood. We make paper, rubber, and even medicines from trees. We pick fruit and nuts from trees. Find out how trees help filter air and water. Discover how trees protect farms and rivers. The leaves of deciduous trees change color when they stop making chlorophyll. Conifers have needles that stay green. The seeds of deciduous trees are in the fruit, but the seeds of conifers are in cones. Formed each year, tree rings are based on the weather. Forests are being cut down to make room for farms and factories."
L-EE,"Decomposers are the F.B.I the F stands for Fungus, B stands for Bacteria and the I stands for Insects. Decomposers are like little cleaners of nature. They decompose until whatever they are decomposing into Carbon Dioxide, Oxygen &amp; Water."
L-EE,"First of all the cycle starts off as a seed. Then the seed gets carbon dioxide, water, sunlight, to grow. After it gets all of those things the seed turns into a small tree and grows out of the ground, this is when the tree also starts to grow roots. After this step the small tree turns into an apple tree, this is when the tree grows apples. After The tree starts getting weak it loses its apples. When the apples fall to the ground and die the seeds are exposed. They go back in the ground or the wind blows them away and moves them to some place else. This is how the cycle keeps on going."
L-EE,"Water onEarthcycles from the oceans, where it evaporates from the surface, into the atmosphere, forms clouds, falls onto the land as rain, travels through wetlands, rivers, lakes and underground then returns to the ocean ã collectively known as the hydrologic cycle."
L-EE,"Humans impact water pollution in many ways-for one, the endless stream of garbage dumped into the ocean. A waterfall of plastic bags,cans, and water bottles are grinding into the beautiful sea life that surrounds our world. This pollution is usually the cause of the millions of sea animals that wash up on our shores, necks, mouths, intestines, and lungs entwined with plastic. Because of this, will dolphins become extinct?Manantee's?"
L-EE,We need water because 75% of the human body is made out of water and also since plants need water and they give us oxygen and we need water to live and we get the oxygen from the plants and we give carbon dioxide back to the plants so basically almost everything need water.
L-EE,The water cycle starts in a lake. water evaporates and goes into clouds. cloud gets dark nd fall of water and rains on land or lakes. water travels through underground. water ends up in the lake when land meets a lake.
L-EF,I do not think so because Ive touch a tree that has fungus on it it did not come on to me 
L-EF,fungus etch dead thing not grow on them
L-EF,fungi and fungus is piratically the same thing   because fungi etch what eve its on sow does fungus but mi us geeing
L-EF,I think so to I ha seen mold on blue sees 
L-EF,is that fungus mushrooms give trees minerals and the tree gives the fungi mushrooms sugar 
L-F, I think that it takes a week or more for fungi to spread I think that fungi spreads to eat and to get energy
L-F, I think that fungus is basically mold because they look the same  there both the same ripe
L-F,I think fungus is a related to mold  like there in the same family there in a family
L-F, I disagree fungi is related to mold they look the same and there in the same family
L-F,how does fungi help the planet I think it helps the trees grow
L-EF,there are two parts of a shadow a umbra dark part which is in the middle and penumbra light part is on the outside part 
L-EF,Your eyes cant fully adjust to the dark but they can a bit my eyes have never fully adjusted to the dark but I have had light near and it was dark because I was near a lot of light then it suddenly changes my body wont react too fast but it can wait a few seconds and it will think I have Benn there long enough but with no light I don't think your eyes can adjust to a perfectly dark room 
L-EF,Lasers are a very very strong source of light they are so hot that they can cut through metal bars with ease diamond sellers cut Simmonds which is one of the hardest substances on earth  
L-EF,Transparent means full SE through so nontransparent means opaque non SEe through 
L-EF,Aura Borealis commonly none as the northern lights are a form of colored light is usual found in the north pole but it can go south like to France or Italy The natives feared them because they thought they were evil things 
L-EF,Photoluminescence is when an animal makes it one light FACT over 70 of the worlds deep sea fish are photoluminescence fireflies are also photoluminescence 
L-EF,photoluminescence is when creatures in small dark places can make them selfs viable for example fire flies have photoluminescence and their is this kind of fish that has a little light on its head 
L-EF,those are the colors of your eye cones What I mean by your eye cones is you have eye cones is that you have cones in your eyes that are shaped like ice cream cones by mixing them you get the Secondary colors 
L-EF,The Secondary colors of light are made by mixing the Primary colors of light here are the Secondary colors of light  Yellow Magenta and Cyan here is how their made  
L-EF,the Northern lights are branches of colored light in the sky you can only see them in the north pole but some times you can see them in muskox in the winter 
L-EF,A transparent object is something you can see though like Stephanie light can go right though it 
L-EF,A translucent object is some thing that you can kind of see though like paper paper is sort of dark sort of light  
L-EF,When you have two light sources facing on one thing and there turned on you see two shadows And the same thing happens when you have three light sources are there but three shadows appear 
L-EF,If you add light to a prism it should change the white light into the colors of the rainbow Red Orange Yellow Green Blue Violet and Indigo
L-EF,My understanding of natural and artificial light is that living things make there own light like fireflies squids bacteria and fungi 70 present of the worlds deep sea fish make their own light 
L-EF,Lasers can burn through the hardest substance like diamonds the hardest things on earth Laser can burn thousands of holes in 1 day 
L-EF,The law of reflection is that if you shine light at a 90 degree angle it will be reflected as a 90 degree angle the light ray that egos to the flat mirror is called the incident ray and the ray that bounces off is called reflected ray 
L-EF,its used in things like flashlights if we didn't use concave mirrors in flashlights it would be like a candle 
L-EF,Convex lens with light rays will concentrate light making a focus point that is the most concentrated and after that it starts to get less concentrated 
L-EF,I also learned that light can not go through an opaque object because it isn't transparent 
L-EF,Another one of the things I learned was that in ancient times people used sundials to tell the time They could tell that the higher the sun was in the sky the shorter the shadow 
L-EF,When light hits a double convex lens it travels together and hits and the light is concentrated at the focal point 
L-EF,Lasers are very bright and they can burn through anything in the world It can burn through steel and chrome and cloth and iron and metal and everything 
L-EF,When white light goes through a prism it will make a rainbow All the colors that come out of the prism will be rainbow colors
L-EF,Chemiluminescence turns chemical energy into light I used to have glowing stars and a moon on the top of my closet so that is an example of chemiluminescence 
L-EF,Making a rainbow with rain is when its raining lightly and the sun is out An example is when you turn on a sprinkler and the sun is shining 
L-EF,when light hits a flat mirror the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection When an incident ray hits a 40 degree angle it will come out a 40 degree angle 
L-EF,A translucent object is not see through That means that you cant look through it But a little light can come through A translucent object can be a pace of paper and an mica computer 
L-EF,A concave mirror has a sort of cave shape We have mirrors that are flat the mirror that I am talking about is that mirror but pushed in This mirror looks like a bowl When you look into it you see a long shape of yourself 
L-EF,a convex mirror is the very opposite This mirror is pushed out This mirror looks like a belly As we gr 4 call it a belly mirror when you look into one of these mirrors you see yourself up side down 
L-EF,concave lens heal near sided people see far sided The light rays goad through the eyes and connect at the back of the head 
L-EF,lasers are very bright and very strong They can go through anything If you put a red balloon inside a a white balloon and shine a laxer on it the balloon will pop 
L-EF,a shadow wilel appear when you are facing north Your shadow wilel be in front of you If you are facing south your shadow wilel be behind you And if you are facing east your shadow wile be on your right and if you are facing west your shadow is on your left 
L-EF,To make white light is to shine blue light red light and green light Shine all of the colors in the same spot Then you will see white light Here is a picture to make it more simple 
L-EF,Light can be diffused when light is shone and hits a bumpy mirror and reflects and the light spreads out like a concave lens  whits is called diffused reflection 
L-EF,To make a rainbow withs prism is simple  Just get a prism and go outside Then hold the prism in the air and you'll see a rainbow But sometimes you can not see all the colors
L-EF,Co lours of light You can make white light by mixing red green and blue  primary colors of light light together 
L-EF,The secondary colors of paint are orange  green and violet and they are the colors that the primary colors make when they mix each other 
L-EF,There are three rinds of eye cones in your eyes They are red green and blue They are sensitive to objects that are either yellow red green blue cyan or magenta 
L-EF,The gilt rays from a convex lens go inwards into a point That point is the meeting place of the light 
L-EF,Your eyes can adjust to darkness after a few minutes in pitch blackness In a movie theater the movie has light on the screen but it isn't very bright But at least you can see the outlines of the people that you are sitting between 
L-EF,The angle incidents equals the angle of reflection 
L-EF,A defuse reflection happens when light hits a bumpy mirror 
L-EF,When two different colored lights hit an nontransparent object it makes two different colored shadows one that is on one side of the nontransparent object and one that is one the other lets say that the two different colored lights where red and green and you shined those lights on each side of an nontransparent objects ball One shadow will be green and the other will be red but on either side of the nontransparent object 
L-EF,There are many theories about light there is the straight line theory that is when light travels in straight lines only There is also a theory that is called ripple waves that is when you tutu still water and it makes ripple waves the man that discoverer ripple waves was Christian Huygens The other theory is the combo theory that is when the waves are in the straight lines And there is the cancel out theory and that is where the straight lines cancel the waves 
L-EF,You have three eye cones in your eyes one is red and one is green and one is blue They are all sensitive to there own colors 
L-EF,The next view is the Co lours of Light view with rainbows A rainbow is created when white light hits though a prism and makes a rainbow You can also diffuse a rainbow by letting the light make a rainbow and put another prism beside and it and it creates white light again
L-EF,when light hit a concave mirror the light rays go everywhere but when light rays hit a convex mirror they act normally 
L-EF,You have three eye cones a blue cone a red cone and a green cone The red cone is sensitive to red light the green cone is sensitive to the green light and the blue cone is sensitive to blue light 
L-EF,We have 3 different eye cones The 3 eye cones are 3 different colors those colors are red green and blue 
L-EF,A concave mirror looks like a bowl When light hits a concave mirror it bounces of like in the picture below 
L-EF,There is some thing called the law of reflection The law of reflection on a flat mirror is when the light bounces of the mirror at the same angle it came on to the mirror 
L-EF,A diffused reflection happens on a bumpy mirror Its when all the light goes in lots of directions 
L-EF,Objects that give off their own light are called luminous objects Light sources don't have to be natural to be luminous The sun is luminous as well 
L-EF,Thermoluminescence is different souses that glow by friction and can create blue sparks One of these sources is wintergreen Life Savers If you are chewing one turn the lights of  Look in a mirror while chewing Look in your mouth and you will see the candy brakes up in to blueish green sparks 
L-EF,Cones are things that respond to colored light There are three kinds of light that cones respond to Red blue and green 
L-EF,Light is the colors of the rainbow compressed to make white light A prism splits up light into separate colorsred orange yellow green blue indigo violet 
L-EF,There are different names for the colors of light Those names are the primary colors of light and the secondary colors of light There not just named orally The primary colors are the first colors that make up the secondary colors 
L-EF,The primary colors are red blue and green The same colors as your eye cones 
L-EF,A convex mirror is shaped like a belly and a concave mirror is shaped like a cave 
L-EF,A concave mirror concentrates the light and a convex mirror does the opposite 
L-EF,A convex mirror since it spreads the light out lets you see more of the stuff behind you A concave mirror since it concentrates light lets you see close up Concave mirrors are used by doctors to see up close 
L-EF,They also have something called the law of reflection The law of reflection is the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection To clarify that if light hits a flat mirror at say a 75 degree angle it is going to come off the mirror at a 75 degree angle 
L-EF,You can add another lens to one of those lenses also A double concave lens would spread out the light and a double convex would concentrate the light 
L-EF,There are two kinds of light Natural and artificial Natural light is light from a natural light source and artificial light is something that is made from a artificial light source like light bulbs 
L-EF,But first natural light There are two sections that I am going to write about First photoluminescence Photoluminescence is made from a living thing Like electric sale They make their own light Therefore electric sale are electroluminescent So are glow worms squids fireflies and even bacteria and fungi 
L-EF,The second thing is fluorescence That is made with friction Like when two stones rub together They make fire whits is heat and light That is fluorescence 
L-EF,News flash If you put a red balloon inside a white balloon and shine a laser at it the laser will pop the red balloon but the white balloon will be unharmed 
L-EF,And umbra is made when you shine a light source over an object that is bigger than the light source That makes a big shadow that is pretty darker 
L-EF,A penumbra is when you shine a light source on something that is smaller than the light source That makes a little umbra and a penumbra which is lighter 
L-EF,Eye cones are things that are in your eyes and they see every thing is upside down The image goes threw the eye cone and to the brain and the brain turns it rightsize 
L-EF,fl you want to make a rainbow you put a prism down and you shine a flashlight at it All the colors will come out the other side
L-EF,An umbra is a dark shadow and a penumbra is a light shadow for instance if a light is really dim you will have a penumbra if the light is sting its an umbra 
L-EF,We did an ensnarement with different colored projector lenses and an opaque ball handing from the sling and we saw shadows First we saw 1 shadow when we terned on 1 light there was a dark shadow when we turned on 2 lights there were 2 light shadows and uprise surprise when we toned on all the lights there were 3 light shadows 
L-EF,Shadows on the earth are not completely black but the shadows on the moon they are 
L-EF,The rainbow is made up of colored light The colors of the rainbow are red orange yellow green blue indigo and violet 
L-EF,There are three eye cones in our eyes and the colors are red green and blue 
L-EF,A concave object is is pushed back and if you look into a concave mirror you see yourself upside and 
L-EF,a convex object is pushed out and if you look into a convex mirror you see yourself right side up but you are very large 
L-EF,When colored light is shined at a opaque object the shadow is black like a normal shadow but when you shine two colored lights there are two shadow and the colors are the colors of the light 
L-EF,Sundials are a form of telling time You can tell the time by the position of the shadow 
L-EF,Shadows also are used to tell directions like north and south you also look at the shadow and that will tell you the direction you are walking in 
L-EF,A concave mirror is a mirror that goes in and when light is shewn on it the light gets focused 
L-EF,A convex mirror is a mirror that goes out and when you shine light on it the light bounces off straight looking 
L-F,All of the secondary colors mixed together equals white light 
L-F,A transparent object is clear and lets 100 light pass through 
L-F,A translucent object is clear swell but only lets 50 go through 
L-F,An opaque object lets 0 through 
L-F,The law of reflection on a flat mirror is The angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection 
L-F,The secondary colors are yellow cyan and magenta yellow indigo and purple 
L-F,Red and blue make magenta 
L-F,Blue and green make cyan and 
L-F,green and red make yellow 
L-F,All three primary colors make white 
L-F,Light and materials The most useful materials to use in experiments about light are lenses and mirrors But first mirrors There are two kinds of mirrors There names are concave and convex 
L-F,You cant forget flat mirrors There sort of in the middle Flat mirrors are pretty important to 
L-F,That law only works for smooth mirrors though 
L-F,On bumpy mirrors the reflected ray would go in all directions That is a called a diffused reflection 
L-F,Now lenses There are two kinds of lenses Concave and convex Just like the mirrors they do the same things 
L-F,Lenses are transparent 
L-F,There are two other forms that Translucent and opaque 
L-F,A transparent object means see through 
L-F,a translucent object colors the light and 
L-F,an opaque object means that it stops the light completely 
L-F,Now  artificial light First chemiluminescence Chemiluminescence is when chemicals react to make light 
L-F,Then there are lasers Lasers are extremely bright and very strong They can go through anything 
L-F,There are two different ways you can play with shadows One is an umbra and the other is a penumbra 
L-F,Those are the small the things to do with shadows but there are much bigger things Those things are eclipses There are two eclipses that we know of Solar and lunar 
L-F,3 Is it true that we cant see without light Of course not 
L-F,The colors of light I think are in the rainbow winch are redOrangeYellowGreenBlueIndigoand Violet 
L-F,The primary colors of light are red green and blue 
L-F,the primary colors of pigment paint are Bluebeard yellow 
L-F,There are 2 rinds of light natural and artificial The kind of light that is in your home is artificial if all the windows are covers 
L-F,Photoluminescence is light made by animals such as fireflies and the tiny fish that live at the bottom of the sea winch my mom loves 
L-F,The aurora Borealis is very bucketful it is light that hits the sky probably threw water that is why it looks waive 
L-F,fl you want to make white light you mix red blue and green together and you have white light 
L-F,A lunar eclipse is when the earth is in front of the moon 
L-F,a solar eclipse is when the moon goes in front of the earth 
L-F,A concave mirror is a mirror that is bent in 
L-F,A convex mirror is a mirror that is bent out 
L-F,Photoluminescence is made by animals whose habits don't have much light 
L-F,Misalliance is made by semicircles 
L-F,Transparent objects are objects that you see threw 
L-F,translucent is when only some light can shine threw 
L-F,concave mirrors reflect light out and convex mirrors footrace the light 
L-F,the law of reflection on a flat mirror is the light goes onto the mirror and bounces in the isopleth direction 
L-F,the law of diffuse refection is the light goes to the mirror and bounces in the same detection 
L-F,concave lenses and light rays help near sited people see far sited and 
L-F,convex mirrors help far sited people see near sited 
L-F,solar powered things are made with solar panels 
L-F,lasers are a toolbox they melt mettle 
L-F,An penumbra is a shadow shining around the shadow 
L-F,An umbra is a dark shadow that comes from a small light 
L-F,An opaque is an nontransparent thing 
L-F,Chemiluminescence is produced by a chemical reaction 
L-F,Luminescence is made by living things 
L-F,Lasers are very bright and intense and can burn through anything 
L-F,Things that glow have florescences 
L-F,Co lours of light The primary colors of light are red blue and green 
L-F,And the secondary colors of light are yellow magenta and cyan 
L-F,Black light is made up of all the colors 
L-F,and white light reflects everything 
L-F,If you look at something that is blue all the colors are absorbed except blue and that is for every other color 
L-F,Light and materials A transparent object is a see through 
L-F,a translucent object is see through but a little burier 
L-F,An opaque object is not see through 
L-F,The law of reflection is if light hit s a mirror on a 90 degree angle and it goes back ons 90 degree angle 
L-F,Diffuse reflection is if you crumple tin foil the light goes all over the place 
L-F,A convex lens concentrates the light 
L-F,a concave lens spreads the light out 
L-F,the primary colors of light are red green and blue 
L-F,The secondary colors of light are Yellow magenta and cyan

L-EF,"Ants can carry dirt on their back like when they carry food. ant hills has lots of rooms, like one of the room is where the queen lives and lays eggs. If There is no queen ant, but there is a ""King Ant"" Which is not a tig maybe the ""King Ant"" Leads their ant colonie to another ant colonie where that ant colonie has a queen"
L-EF,"The information I have learned is all from brainpop.[ - There are over 12,000 species of ants, many species have different behaviors. I have also learned the ""exoskeleton"" around the ant protects the ant, but it also helps the ant move about. My final thing I learned was that male ants are called ""drones"" and their only job is to mate with the queen to create eggs, afterwords, they die.- ]"
L-EF,some trees change color and die during the cold weather in the fall and in winter. But some of them like the tall GREEN tree and pine trees. Now you know why pine trees are christmas trees. Also It would be a little weird if you hang ornaments on deciduous trees. deciduous trees are those trees that chane color in the winter and die.
L-EF,Salva has a journey to his home town to eathiopia. At the beggening of the journey he had to walk and than get the honey and than walk some more and than get his uncle to join his journey and than let his uncle to hunt down food and than eat the food and than walk some more and than help fix the boat and than test the boat and than eat some food and than get mosquito bites and than travel on the river.
L-EF,for this experiment at school that I did at class was that we tried to move water from the ground to the table and we kind of had some mistakes the litle plugs kept coming of and we did not get much water in the first test but on second we improved so it shows me that when you first do somting it does not go well but if your trying again you will succeed
L-EF,"Our Test diagram was the 3 way vowel on top and the pipe in the water the first test we got 41 ML and the difficulties we had were keeping the pipe in the water and the 3 way vowel we had trouble working it so we wasted some time. What we modified we taped the pipe to the cup so it can stay and taped the cup to the table just in case, the water we moved was 101 ML our difficulties were turning the thing on the 3 way vowel fast, our controls pulling and turning the thing on the 3 way vowel and the thing that was hard and not fair was you can not touch the other things. In Enrichment some people went outside to get water they got a bit of water the people inside got more and we had to put it on our heads."
L-EF,"When we did our latest project, It was about filtering water. unfortunetly, our water was gray. I think it was becuase of too much air carbon. we used it in two of our steps instead of one. next time, we need less carbon, and also switch the steps around. filtering water is important because nya's sister got sick from drinking dirty water. my theory is that she got sick because there are actually nitrates in dirty water an nitrates aren't good for the human body. New information that I want to learn is ""What chemicals are in nitrate and how are they bad for us to drink? and how are they made exactly?"""
L-EF,"In the last chapter ofA Long Walk To Water, Salva visits schools to talk about the project and to raise money. but then it skips two years ahead to 2009. nya looks at a man holding up a poster. uncle read it out and now they have clean water! as soon as I found out my prediction was that the man was salva and he was doing his project there. and I was right! but I also found out years ago salva's tribe was in war with nya's. I know this becuase nya said that salva had different markings/scars on his face. also, when nya got the clean water, she was looking at the clarity of how it was so clear. this made me compare it to when we were filtering the water and how it was a little bit more clear after. I was also suprised when it was all based on a true story except for some parts. this made me compare to when we had a budget of 100$ and we needed to buy the materials without spending too much and we had to pump it and filter it and it was very hard but I think it was harder for salva becuase he needed the right materials and they were more expensive."
L-EF,[ - in each ant family( ant hill) there is one queen ant. the queen ant gives birth to babies. When the baby ants are born they are usally white. as they grow up they turn black.- ] thousands and thousands ofants live in one ant hill like an apartment. ants eat sweet fruits and other sweet things. there are many different kinds of ants. Ants live everywhere!!!
L-EF,"[-Grasshoppers go through 4 stages of their life cycle egg,Nymph,adult Grasshoppers, and death. A nymph looks like a little adut Grasshopper.But with out wings - ]"
L-EF,"I think you miss understood. This is the mosse‚s spores perpuse :) :Mosses reproduce using spores, not seeds, and have no flowers. Moss gametophytes have stems which may be simple orbranchedand upright or prostrate. Their leaves are simple, usually only a single layer of cells with no internal air spaces, often with thicker midribs."
L-EF,"groups of ants are called coloniessome ants are so small a person can barely see themsome ants eat small animals, some insects, and some plants and more foodsants are soocial insects"
L-EF,"[ -After what bill said: plants are producers and animals that eat plants are herbivores. when herbivores eat the plant, that plant that has stored energy that goes into an animal willthen the animal have energy as well. an animal that eats a herbivore is called a carnivore. the energy will go into the carnivore. when animals die there is something called decomposers which take the energy from the animal and put it in the soil for new plants to grow there. this is called a food web. - ] Quote from Bill Nye the science guy: food is fuel and energy. - varsha's add on information!"

L-EF,"Parts of a plantThe blade is broad and flat. A stalk attaches the blade to the stem. A simple leaf has one bade and a compond leaf has several blades on the same petiole.Veins in the leave carry food and water from the leaves to the rest of the plant. They also make a strong support that give the leaves its shape. The veins of a broad leaf form a netlike pattern. The veins of narrow leaves are parallel. ( leaves size are also adapted by habitat and maximize photosynthesis.)"

L-EF,"The following are examples of structures and organelles that can be found in typical plantcells:Cell (plasma) Membrane: This thin, semi-permeable membrane surrounds the cytoplasm of a cell, enclosing its contents.Cell Wall: This rigid outer covering of the cell protects the plant cell and gives it shape.Chloroplast: Chloroplasts are the sites of photosynthsisin a plant cell. They contain chlorophyll, a green pigment that absorbs energy from sunlight.Cytoplasm: The gel-like substance within the cell membrane is known as cytoplasm. It contains water, enzymes, salts, organelles, and various organic molecules.Cytoskeleton: This network of fibers throughout the cytoplasm helps the cell maintain its shape and gives support to the cell."
L-EF,"Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER): The Endoplamic Reticulumis an extensive network of membranes composed of both regions with ribosomes (rough ER) and regions without ribosomes (smooth ER). The ER synthesizes proteinsand lipids.Golgi complex: This organelle is responsible for manufacturing, storing and shipping certain cellular products including proteins.Mictotubules: These hollow rods function primarily to help support and shape the cell. They are important for chromosomemovement in mitosisand mieosis, as well as cytosol movement within a cell.Mitochondria: Mitochondria generate energy for the cell by converting glucose (produced by photosynthesis) and oxygen to ATP. This process is known as respiration.Nucleus: The nucleus is a membrane-bound structure that contains the cell's hereditary information (DNA).Nucleolus:This structure within the nucleus helps in the synthesis of ribosomes.Nucleopore:These tiny holes within the nuclear membrane allow nucleic acidsand proteinsto move into and out of the nucleus."
L-EF,"Leaves have unique structures, called veins, that transport liquids and nutrients to leaf cells. Veins also carry the products of photosynthesis back to the rest of the tree.A tree leaf has several types of veins. The central one is called the midrib or midvein. Other veins connect to the midrib and have their own unique patterns.Tree leaf veins in dicots (we also call these trees hardwoods or deciduous trees) are all considered to be net-veined or reticulate-veined.This means that the veins branch from the main rib and then sub-branch into finer veins.There are two classifications you need to"
L-EF,"Peroxisomes: Peroxisomes are tiny, single membrane bound structures that contain enzymes which produce hydrogen peroxide as a by-product. These structures are involved in plant processes such as photorespiration.Plasmodesmata:These pores or channels are found between plant cell walls and allow molecules and communication signals to pass between individual plant cells.Ribosomes: Consisting of RNAand proteins, ribosomes are responsible for protein assembly. They can be found either attached to the rough ER or free in the cytoplasm.Vacuole: This plant cell organelle provides support for and participates in a variety of cellular functions including storage, detoxification, protection, and growth. When a plant cell matures, it typically contains one large liquid-filled vacuole."
L-EF,"Fruits, vegetables, and flowers come from plants. Plants include ferns and mosses, but not mushrooms. They live in soil, water, or even the air. Leaves have something inside that can turn sunlight into food. Flowers and pollen are needed for plants to make fruit and seeds. The sweet smell of flowers attracts bees and butterflies to spread pollen to other flowers. The bugs drink the nectar and the pollen sticks to them. Find out how plants help us survive."
L-EF,"Plants need carbon dioxide, sunlight, and water for photosynthesis. Photosynthesis is how the plant makes oxygen and food."
L-EF,I have learned that moss detaches from the thing it's on when it's going to start to die. I know from my experiment of takeing detached moss and putting it into good soil. After a few of days it was no longer detachable.

L-F,today we did a water challenge. the challenge was that you had to move 100mL of water 100 centimeters to another beaker. the challenge was a bit hard at first but when we got a hang of it.
L-F,"Our plan worked! Here are our stuff we had, 4 tubes 1 ,3 -way valve , 6 connectors , 2 beakers (always), and a sringe , and a measuring tape."
L-F,"[ - When we worked in teams of 4/3, We made a tube that we could fill water with and we made it to the second challange- ]"
L-F,"During this experiment, I learned it's kinda hard to transfor the water to the cup because you have to come up with a plan etc."
L-F,"well i guess it could be hard if you did not have a plan but other wise, It would not be that hard."

L-F,our groups desigened work we use white fiter then carbon and brown fiter. next time we wont pour too much dirt water in the carbon so it wont go on the table.
L-F,in class we had to filter water with a coffee filter and we learned that if you double the coffee filter over it will do better against the dirty water.
L-F,"To reflect on todays science expirement, I know that I should use carbon as the second step instead of the first."
L-F,so I think that our 3 part filter was good but we messed up on the actived carbon because we did not put in a filter so the water would just stay there
L-F,"When we made the filter we used the W.filter , A. carbon and then B. filter when we filterd the water it turned out clear."
L-F,"When I did the thing which you have to try to turn the dirty water into clean, it was kinda hard because my group sometimes fight, but we did it, but we thought we could use more of the active carbon but that made the water cloudy and dirty, it clean before we use all the active carbon."
