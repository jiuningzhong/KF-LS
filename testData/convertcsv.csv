E-S,L-E,explanation,rainbow,Rainbows are when light goes through rain droplets that act like prisms 
E-S,L-E,explanation,rainbow,The order of colors in the rainbow goes Red Orange yellow Green Blue Indigo Violet its in that order because of the light waves red is the longest light wave and violet is the shortest light wave 
E-H,L-F,fact,rainbow,Rainbows can only be made by sun light 
E-BS,L-EF,fact,postimage,about colors when you look at a red object for at least 10 seconds and then look at a white suffuse and it will have the same shape but it will be green

E-S,L-F,fact,pri&sec,Win you mix all of t hem together it makes white 
E-BS,L-E,explanation,objects,This is how we see different colored objects when you see a yellow flower it is because all the primary colors of light hit it red and green light bounce off of the flower into your eye 
E-BS,L-E,explanation,object,its the same with magenta except blue  red nonces off 
E-BS,L-E,explanation,objects,its also the same with cyan except blue  green light bounces off 
E-BS,L-EE,explanation,objects,When you see a red flower the red light bounces off the flower in to our eyes and the green blue gets absorbed 
E-BS,L-E,explanation,shadow,Shadows are made when light hits an opaque object and so then it makes shadow The shadow is allays attacher to a opaque object 
E-BS,L-F,fact,shadow,The umbra part of a shadow is darker then the penumbra part

E-BS,L-E,explanation,lens,It dost focus the light  
E-BS,L-F,fact,materials,Transparent amens that all the light goes through 
E-BS,L-F,fact,materials,Translucent means that only some light goes 
E-BS,L-F,fact,materials,opaque means that no light goes through 
E-BS,L-F,fact,reflection,the law of reflection is when light hits a mirror at an angle it nonces of in the same angle 
E-BS,L-F,fact,diffused,The diffuse reflection means that when there is a bumpy shine surfs the light goes every where

E-H,L-F,fact,glow,florescence is a chemical that glows 
E-U,L-F,fact,travel,Our class had a debate on how light travels at first we only had 2 theories straight  wave then we had particles ripples wave inside a tub We 
E-S,L-F,fact,pri&sec,The primary colors of light are red green and blue 
E-S,L-F,fact,pri&sec,The secondary councilors of light are cyan yellow and magenta 
E-S,L-F,fact,pri&sec,wen you mix all the primary colors of light together you see white light 
E-BS,L-EE,explanation,prism&rainbow,When you shine a light through a glass prism it ell make a rainbow on the surface it needs to be white light of the colors light wail be to strong and wont split up into the rainbow
E-H,L-E,explanation,rainbow,If you shine a light through a stem of water you will see a rainbow in the water 
E-BS,L-E,explanation,objects,Wen you see a red rose the blue and green are being absorbed and the red will be reflected and you see a red rose 
E-BS,L-E,explanation,objects,Wen you look at a yellow rose the to colors that are reflected are red and green they make yellow The blue is absorbed and you cant see it 
E-H,L-EE,explanation,objects,This is how absorbing and reflecting works the colors that make the object will be reflected and the leftover color will be wasted not used 
E-BS,L-EF,fact,postimage,Eye cones are in are eyes and some are sensitive to red blue and green and if the red con is not working then you cant see any thing to do with red or red 
E-BS,L-E,explanation,northern,Other Lights our when the sun boards the earth with tiny particles of belletristic they hit the earths attester the air and electricity makes it glow 
E-BS,L-F,fact,materials,An transparent object Is a objectt that you can sealy see through like glass 
E-BS,L-F,fact,materials,An translucent object is a object or material that you can see the couplers through it but you cant see crustal clear like rice paper 
E-BS,L-EF,fact,materials,An Opaque object is a object is an object that you cant see through like metal opaque objects are uselessly the strongest material 
E-BS,L-EF,fact,lens,A convex lens is a lens that consent rats the light beam so when you look at the sore it will be a dot 
E-BS,L-EF,fact,lens,Thats the ope sit of a concave lens it makes the light sored out you so if your flash light wont sored out then you can holed up a concave lens to the sore of light and it will sored out and cover a larger area but with less power 
E-BS,L-EF,fact,reflection,The angle of incidents equals the angle of reflection that mens if you shine a light sore on a flare mirror then the angle you shewn the light on the mirror is the angle it will reflect 
E-BS,L-F,fact,diffused,If you shin a light on a crumpled up puce of tin fowl then the light will be every where thats called defuse reflection 
E-BS,L-EF,fact,reflection,A concave mirror is a spoon like mirror If you walk away from it you MIG is upside down but if you walk closer then its right side up 
E-BS,L-F,fact,reflection,If you look into a convex then you look bait stretched outland the sides are rill bleary 
E-H,L-F,fact,sunpanel,A soler panel takes light and converts it to energy

E-BS,L-F,fact,glow,Florescence thing arch thing that glow like those bedroom star 
E-H,L-F,fact,laser,A laser is a hilly intense tool its all the tools 
E-S,L-EE,explanation,shadow,A shadow is mad by an object in front of a light stream The light cant go around and then no light git be hind the objects and its dark 
E-BS,L-F,fact,shadow,An umbra is the dark shadow 
E-BS,L-F,fact,shadow,A penumbra is the light shadow 
E-BS,L-EE,explanation,eclipse,A solar eclipse is an eclipse of the sun It occurs when the moon is located between the sun and the earth The moon blocks the sunlight coming to the earth 
E-BS,L-E,explanation,eclipse,A liner elicits is when the sun is behind the earth and the moons in front of the earth 
E-BS,L-EE,explanation,travel,My theory is that light travels in waves I leaned this by doing an ensnarement the end resale was a wave pattern Like doping to pebbles in a pond and the reason is like light 
E-BS,L-E,explanation,travel,Light travels in inviable waves so it acts like a straight line but is actually waves 
E-BS,L-F,fact,refraction,Water bends light 
E-H,L-E,explanation,travel,Light wave length is shorter then ultra violet waves which are inviable to our eyes so some people still think that light travels in a straight line It was proved by many people a long time ago 
E-BS,L-EF,fact,lens,Most lenses focuses light so if a weak but large source of light is being produced and you put a lens under it then it will make the weak light focus and become strong 
E-BS,L-F,fact,lens,Some lenses make light spread out 
E-H,L-F,fact,lens,there are many types of lenses there are glasses magnifying glasses and many many more 
E-H,L-EE,explanation,glow,Most glowing things are painted with a layer of fluorescent paint this paint absorbs light and when it is dark the absorbed light would unleash the light that it saved until its empty and has no more light 
E-S,L-F,fact,pri&sec,There are primary colors and secondary colors The primary colors of light are red blue and green 
E-S,L-F,fact,pri&sec,Red and green make yellow light 
E-S,L-F,fact,pri&sec,green and blue light make cyan 
E-S,L-F,fact,pri&sec,and red and blue make magenta 
E-S,L-F,fact,pri&sec,and all three make  WHITE 
E-S,L-F,fact,pri&sec,and the secondary colors are magenta cyan and yellow 
E-BS,L-F,fact,rainbow,Rainbows are light colors you can see 
E-BS,L-EF,fact,prism&rainbow,you make a rainbow with a prism if you put a source of light in front of a glass prism you usably don't see a perfect rainbow mane not even a rainbow but sometimes you can see a small rainbow
E-H,L-EE,explanation,rainbow,but that doesn't explain why sometimes there are rainbows after rain storms or when it rains the answer to this is raindrops act as prisms but when I did a experiment at my house i filled a glass of water and turned out the lights I didn't see even a tiny outline of a rainbow 
E-H,L-EF,fact,reflection,When light hits a flat mirror at a 20 degree angle it goes out of the flat mirror at a 20 degree angle this means the angle of reflection equals the angle of incidence so light if it goes in at any number angle it will come out at the same angle but this only works with a flat mirror 
E-BS,L-F,fact,diffused,If you use it with aluminum foil thats all crumpled up then light will go out at all sides this is called a diffuse reflection 
E-BS,L-EF,fact,reflection,There are many types of mirrors there are flat mirrors which in the last paragraph is the only type of mirror that will make light go out at the same angle that it came in a flat mirror is the most comment mirror 
E-BS,L-EF,fact,reflection,but there are two more basic ones One is the concave mirror This mirror looks like a cave It goes in and bounces light inside it 
E-BS,L-F,fact,reflection,Unlike convex mirrors convex mirrors can bounce off many sides Those are the basic mirrors 
E-H,L-EF,fact,diffused,If a shiny thing like tin foil is there but bent the law of reflection doesn't work The light goes all over the place 
E-BS,L-EF,fact,reflection,Convex mirrors make your vision all you can see in the area bigger so if you look in a convex mirror you will see a lot more behind you thees are used in places like cars 
E-H,L-E,explanation,shadow,A shadow is made by an opaque object nontransparent object and when you shine the light through the opaque object you can see a black spot that black spot is a shadow 
E-BS,L-EF,fact,shadow,there are two parts of a shadow a umbra dark part which is in the middle and penumbra light part is on the outside part 
E-BS,L-EE,explanation,eclipse,There are two types of eclipses The rift one is called a solar eclipse Its when the moon goes in front of the earth and behind the sun which casts a shadow upon earth As I said before an opaque object like the moon and the sun is the light source it makes a shadow 
E-BS,L-EE,explanation,eclipse,a lunar eclipse is the opiate of a solar eclipse a lunar eclipse is when the earth goes in front of the moon the earth is also opaque but the shadow this time is bigger 
E-BS,L-EF,fact,see,Your eyes cant fully adjust to the dark but they can a bit my eyes have never fully adjusted to the dark but I have had light near and it was dark because I was near a lot of light then it suddenly changes my body wont react too fast but it can wait a few seconds and it will think I have Benn there long enough but with no light I don't think your eyes can adjust to a perfectly dark room 
E-BS,L-EF,fact,laser,Lasers are a very very strong source of light they are so hot that they can cut through metal bars with ease diamond sellers cut Simmonds which is one of the hardest substances on earth  
E-BS,L-F,fact,materials,Opaque transparent and translucent are some terms in light Opaque means that its non see through 
E-BS,L-F,fact,materials,Translucent means that some light can go through but not all so part see through 
E-BS,L-EF,fact,materials,Transparent means full SE through so nontransparent means opaque non SEe through 
E-BS,L-EE,explanation,objects,If light hits a red rose red gets reflected and blue and green get absorbed thats why we see red 
E-BS,L-EE,explanation,objects,but with a yellow rose green and red get reflected and blue gets absorbed because red and green make yellow 
E-BS,L-EF,fact,northern,Aura Borealis commonly none as the northern lights are a form of colored light is usual found in the north pole but it can go south like to France or Italy The natives feared them because they thought they were evil things 
E-H,L-E,explanation,sunpanel,Solar panels are usably used in places where they want to absorb light what a solar panel is basically is a thing that absorbs light stead of reflecting light so it can give off light later on 
E-BS,L-EF,fact,bio,Photoluminescence is when an animal makes it one light FACT over 70 of the worlds deep sea fish are photoluminescence fireflies are also photoluminescence 
E-BS,L-E,explanation,postimage,You have three eye cones in your eyes to SEe different couplers like I said before the easy way to SE many couplers is you need blue red and green so they are blue red and green 
E-H,L-E,explanation,glow,glowing things is that it needs to absorb light to work 
E-H,L-F,fact,glow,To see a white shrift glow you need purple light 
E-BS,L-EF,fact,bio,photoluminescence is when creatures in small dark places can make them selfs viable for example fire flies have photoluminescence and their is this kind of fish that has a little light on its head 
E-BS,L-F,fact,glow,chemiluminescence is the chemical that make things glow 
E-BS,L-F,fact,glow,Fluorescence is the process of demitting light while receiving energy from another source 
E-BS,L-F,fact,laser,Lasers are very highly bright and intense light  They can burn though anything 
E-H,L-E,explanation,shadow,A shadow is a reflection of light hitting an object To see a shadow you need a source of light like the sun or a flash light 
E-BS,L-F,fact,shadow,here is a example of umbra and penumbra when you put an easer under a flash light the black shadow is the umbra and the gray shadow is the penumbra 
E-BS,L-EE,explanation,eclipse,A lunar eclipse is when the moon over laps the sun and blackens out the sky so no one ca see the sun and the sun and the moon turn black 
E-H,L-E,explanation,eclipse,A solar eclipse is when the sun over laps the moon band then the sun and the moon go red 
E-H,L-E,explanation,shadow,This is how a shadow is made  a shadow is made when light hits an object 
E-S,L-F,fact,pri&sec,the primary colors of light are  Green Red and Blue 
E-BS,L-EF,fact,postimage,those are the colors of your eye cones What I mean by your eye cones is you have eye cones is that you have cones in your eyes that are shaped like ice cream cones by mixing them you get the Secondary colors 
E-S,L-EF,fact,pri&sec,The Secondary colors of light are made by mixing the Primary colors of light here are the Secondary colors of light  Yellow Magenta and Cyan here is how their made  
E-S,L-F,fact,pri&sec,Yellow is made by mixing Green and Red  
E-S,L-F,fact,pri&sec,Magenta is made by Blue and Red 
E-S,L-F,fact,pri&sec,and Cyan is made by blue and Green 
E-S,L-F,fact,pri&sec,This is how we see white we mix  Red Blue and Green all together make white 
E-H,L-EE,explanation,object,What is absorbing My understanding is that when white light hits a red object all the colors that make white  Red Green and Blue blue and green are reflected and red is absorbed 
E-H,L-EE,explanation,object,What is Reflecting My understanding is like before we have a red dress when white light hits the red dress blue and green are reflected and red is absorbed Why I think there reflected is because its not the same color 
E-BS,L-EE,explanation,object,this is how we can see a red rose white light hits the rose red is reflected and blue and green are absorbed and the rose papers upside down and back wards but your brain turns it to the right way 
E-H,L-EE,explanation,object,this is how we see a yellow rose the white light hits the rose green and red are reflected and blue is absorbed why green and red are reflected incited of just one color is because yellow is a secondary color and are brain sees the rose upside down and backwards 
E-BS,L-E,explanation,prism&rainbow,This is why how you make a rainbow with a prism you get a prism and shine a light though the prism and then you will see a prism rainbow
E-BS,L-EF,fact,northern,the Northern lights are branches of colored light in the sky you can only see them in the north pole but some times you can see them in muskox in the winter 
E-BS,L-E,explanation,rainbow,how we make a rainbow with rain  After it rains you see a rainbow its made by the sun light shining though the water and it makes a rainbow 
E-BS,L-EF,fact,materials,A transparent object is something you can see though like Stephanie light can go right though it 
E-BS,L-EF,fact,materials,A translucent object is some thing that you can kind of see though like paper paper is sort of dark sort of light  
E-BS,L-F,fact,materials,An opaque object is something that you cant see though at all like a base ball or a baseball bat 
E-BS,L-F,fact,reflection,A concave mirror is a mirror that has cave the image looks like your head is bent 
E-BS,L-F,fact,reflection,A convex mirror is something that looks like somebodies belly The image looks like your head is bent out ward 
E-BS,L-F,fact,reflection,The law of relation is when the angle of incandescence  the angle of reflection 
E-BS,L-F,fact,infused,When light hits a bumpy surface its rays are reflected every where  
E-H,L-F,fact,lens,A double concave lens is a magnifying glass lens when light gos though it it soots out every where 
E-BS,L-F,fact,camera,On a camera there is a convex lens to help focus the light when the light gos though the lens it gets concertinaed  
E-BS,L-E,explanation,sunpanel,Solar panel absorb light and change it to solar energy 
E-BS,L-E,explanation,travel,My theory about how light travels is that light travels in ripple waves 
E-BS,L-E,explanation,see,My theory about all we see is light is that every thing we see is light 
E-BS,L-F,fact,shadow,My understanding of shadows are that shadows are always on the other side of the light source 
E-H,L-F,fact,shadowsize,The closer you get to the light the bigger your shadow gets 
E-BS,L-EF,fact,shadow,When you have two light sources facing on one thing and there turned on you see two shadows And the same thing happens when you have three light sources are there but three shadows appear 
E-BS,L-E,explanation,shadow,the way a shadow is made is that you are covering part of where the light hits 
E-BS,L-F,fact,shadow,and the complete black area is called umbra 
E-BS,L-F,fact,shadow,and where its Grey is called penumbra 
E-BS,L-EE,explanation,eclipse,New information A lunar eclipse is when the earth is between the sun and the moon Since the earth is in front of the moon it castes a shadow over the moon making it in total darkness 
E-BS,L-EE,explanation,eclipse,A solar eclipse is when the moon casts a show over the earth and its just like a lunar eclipse precept what I just told you 
E-BS,L-EF,fact,prism&rainbow,If you add light to a prism it should change the white light into the colors of the rainbow Red Orange Yellow Green Blue Violet and Indigo
E-BS,L-E,explanation,rainbow,My understanding of rainbows is that the reason that there always in the same order is that Red has the longest light wave and violet the shortest 
E-S,L-F,fact,pri&sec,My understanding of the primary colors of light are Red Green and Blue 
E-S,L-F,fact,pri&sec,but the primary colors of pigment are Yellow Blue and Red 
E-S,L-F,fact,pri&sec,Blue and Green makes cyan 
E-S,L-F,fact,pri&sec,Red and Blue makes magenta 
E-S,L-F,fact,pri&sec,and Red and Green makes yellow 
E-BS,L-F,fact,pri&sec,Of course if you were in pigment yellow would be green 
E-BS,L-EE,explanation,objects,The way we see a red rose is that white light contains the primary coleus of light red blue and green What happens is that the red light hitting a red rose the red light bounces off and into our eyes and the other colors get absorbed 
E-H,L-EE,explanation,objects,With a yellow ors its pretty much the same thing but 2 colors don't get absorbed they mix and bounce off as one ray 
E-BS,L-E,explanation,objects,Anything that isn't the same color gets absorbed the same color is always reflected 
E-S,L-F,fact,postimage,Every person has eye cones that are sensitive to a servant color Each eye con is sensitive to either red blue or green 
E-H,L-F,fact,postimage?,Try clewing one eye then switching one eye looks more red the other more blue since we don't have a third eye we see blue and red and not green because in pigment its replaced with yellow 
E-BS,L-F,fact,Northern,The northern light are the color red eerie green and pink 
E-BS,L-EE,explanation,northern,The northern lights are cosed by partials from the sun The particles are so small you couldn't see them How they acute is when the particles hit highest thing of the earths atmosphere they electrify the air making it glow 
E-BS,L-E,explanation,rainbow,Rainbows are sometimes made when leftover raindrops The raindrops acts as prisms 
E-BS,L-EF,fact,bio,My understanding of natural and artificial light is that living things make there own light like fireflies squids bacteria and fungi 70 present of the worlds deep sea fish make their own light 
E-BS,L-F,fact,glow,chemiluminescence is when chemicals make things glow like luminescent paint 
E-BS,L-E,explanation,glow,other things make things glow in the dark like electricity heat and friction 
E-BS,L-F,fact,glow,Fluorescence is when something is giving off light while getting energy from another source 
E-BS,L-EF,fact,laser,Lasers can burn through the hardest substance like diamonds the hardest things on earth Laser can burn thousands of holes in 1 day 
E-BS,L-F,fact,materials,My understanding of transparent objects is that if you look at it you should see through it roughly A transparent object is usually like a window some toys and glass 
E-S,L-EF,fact,reflection,The law of reflection is that if you shine light at a 90 degree angle it will be reflected as a 90 degree angle the light ray that egos to the flat mirror is called the incident ray and the ray that bounces off is called reflected ray 
E-BS,L-EE,explanation,diffused,Diffused reflection is when a ray of light comes and hits something like bumpy tinfoil The light comes and egos everywhere because it has more than one thing to bounce off of it It egos up down right left because when its bumpy it goes like that because of different bumps 
E-PS,L-F,fact,materials,Opaque is a thing that you can see and see through but its fuzzy An opaque object is like plastic 
E-PS,L-F,fact,reflection,a concave mirror when light is shown into it reflects the light all around and then up 
E-BS,L-EF,fact,reflection,its used in things like flashlights if we didn't use concave mirrors in flashlights it would be like a candle 
E-BS,L-EF,fact,lens,Convex lens with light rays will concentrate light making a focus point that is the most concentrated and after that it starts to get less concentrated 
E-BS,L-F,fact,sunpanel,Solar panels can make lots of things do stuff 
E-PS,L-E,explanation,reflection,If you looked into a concave mirror you would see behind you and a lot of light because the light goes in then bounces until it shoots out the way it came 
E-BS,L-EE,explanation,reflection,Convex mirrors are used in stores They let you see around corners and stuff ltd shaped like a ball with the top cut off the way it lets you see around corners is it does everything but catch light so it bounces off as an angle 
E-BS,L-F,fact,materials,Translucent object let some light but not all light through So translucent would be like frosted glass or clouds 
E-BS,L-EE,explanation,object,All we see is light the way I can prove it is that the same color light bounces off things that are supposed to be that color Then the color bounces into your eye Three primary colors are in white light so if you mix those you'll get any color 
E-BS,L-E,explanation,eclipse,I learned that a solar eclipse occurs when the moon blocks the sun which casts a huge shadow over the earth 
E-BS,L-EF,fact,materials,I also learned that light can not go through an opaque object because it isn't transparent 
E-BS,L-EF,fact,sundial,Another one of the things I learned was that in ancient times people used sundials to tell the time They could tell that the higher the sun was in the sky the shorter the shadow 
E-S,L-EE,explanation,eclipse,I just learned that a lunar eclipse occurs when the earth is between the sun and the moon The earth is in front of the moon and behind the sun which makes a huge shadow over the moon

E-BS,L-F,fact,shadow,A penumbra is a lighter shadow 
E-H,L-E,explanation,shadow,A shadow is made by light hitting you and the light is big so it gets around the person and makes a shadow 
E-H,L-F,fact,shadowsize,Also the farther you walk away the longer your shadow will get 
E-BS,L-F,fact,lens,When light hits a double concave lens unlike the double convex the light will go further apart 
E-BS,L-EF,fact,lens,When light hits a double convex lens it travels together and hits and the light is concentrated at the focal point 
E-H,L-F,fact,lens,I learned that a magnifying glass can focus the light more than it can when the light is just by itself 
E-BS,L-E,explanation,electric,I also learned that there are things called atoms and electrons that can pass through wires and make electricity 
E-S,L-F,fact,bio,Another thing I learned was that 70 of the worlds sea fish use photoluminescence to make themselves glow

E-S,L-F,fact,pri&sec,If you mix the primary colors of light you get white light 
E-BS,L-F,fact,prism&rainbow,If you shine light through a prism it makes a rainbow
E-BS,L-E,explanation,rainbow,a rainbow in rain is made because its so damp outside 
E-BS,L-E,explanation,objects,We see a red rose because The primary colors go to the rose and green and blue get absorbed and red bounces off 
E-BS,L-E,explanation,objects,we see a yellow rose because all the secondary colors go at the rose the magenta and cyan gets absorbed but yellow bounces off 
E-BS,L-EF,fact,postimage,You have three eye cones a blue cone a red cone and a green cone The red cone is sensitive to red light the green cone is sensitive to the green light and the blue cone is sensitive to blue light

E-S,L-F,fact,pri&sec,You can make white light by mixing red blue and green 
E-BS,L-EE,explanation,object,A red rose looks red because the red light in the white light reflects of the rose and in to your eyes the blue and green light gets absorbed 
E-BS,L-EE,explanation,object,A yellow flower looks yellow because the red and the green light in the white light are reflexed in to you eyes and the blue is absorbed

E-BS,L-E,explanation,rainbow,You can make a rainbow with a prism by outing light thought a prism of rain Rain is what make the rainbow in the sky 
E-BS,L-F,fact,materials,There are 3 ways to describe an object the 3 ways are transparent translucent and opaque 
E-BS,L-F,fact,materials,A transparent object is like glass you can see through it 
E-BS,L-F,fact,materials,A translucent object is an object that is Ike sand falling through water light can go through it 
E-BS,L-F,fact,materials,An opaque object is like peter light cant go through him 
E-BS,L-EF,fact,reflection,A concave mirror looks like a bowl When light hits a concave mirror it bounces of like in the picture below 
E-BS,L-F,fact,reflection,A convex mirror looks like the picture above on the right 
E-S,L-EF,fact,reflection,There is some thing called the law of reflection The law of reflection on a flat mirror is when the light bounces of the mirror at the same angle it came on to the mirror 
E-BS,L-EF,fact,diffused,A diffused reflection happens on a bumpy mirror Its when all the light goes in lots of directions 
E-BS,L-F,fact,lens,A convex lens focuses the light

E-H,L-F,fact,glow,Things that glow are called fluorescence 
E-BS,L-F,fact,laser,Gazers are very strong and used for a lot of things 
E-BS,L-E,explanation,see,All we see is light Without light we can not see 
E-BS,L-E,explanation,travel,My theory is that light travels in a wavy straight line 
E-BS,L-EE,explanation,shadow,Shadow darkness made when light shines on an opaque nontransparent object If the light shines on an opaque object it is imposable for the shadow to be on the same side the light is coming from unless there is a mirror If there is no light there isn't a shadow So there is a shadow where the light cant reach 
E-BS,L-EE,explanation,eclipse,A lunar eclipse is when the earth is between the sun and the moon and it casts a shadow over the moon 
E-BS,L-E,explanation,eclipse,A solar eclipse is when the sun goes in front of the moon 
E-BS,L-F,fact,stars,The sun is the most important light source 
E-BS,L-EF,fact,glow,Objects that give off their own light are called luminous objects Light sources don't have to be natural to be luminous The sun is luminous as well 
E-BS,L-F,fact,glow,Objects that don't give off light are non luminous 
E-BS,L-F,fact,glow,A flashlight is luminous when on but is non luminous when switched off 
E-BS,L-EE,explanation,glow,Inside luminous objects or animals some form of energy changes into light energy This energy usually changes into chemical electrical thermal and nuclear energy The process of giving off light is called incandescence 
E-BS,L-F,fact,bio,When an animal gives off its own light its called photoluminescence as in biomasses 
E-BS,L-F,fact,glow,Chemiluminescence is produced by certain chemical reactions For example glow sticks 
E-BS,L-F,fact,electric,Electro luminescence is produced by electric discharges For example when silk or fur is stroked or when adhesive surfaces are separated

E-BS,L-F,fact,rainbow,A rainbow is made up of seven different colors Red orange yellow green blue indigo violet 
E-BS,L-E,explanation,rainbow,It is made when raindrops fall on something like a leaf and the sunshine shines through the leaf and the raindrop acts like a prism 
E-S,L-F,fact,pri&sec,The primary colors of light are blue green and red
E-S,L-F,fact,pri&sec,and the secondary colors are yellow magenta and sin 
E-S,L-F,fact,pri&sec,Yellow is made when mixing green and red 
E-S,L-F,fact,pri&sec,magenta is made when mixing red and blue 
E-S,L-F,fact,pri&sec,and sin is made when mixing green and blue 
E-S,L-F,fact,pri&sec,All of the secondary colors mixed together equals white light 
E-BS,L-EE,explanation,postimage,You have three eye cones in your eyes One is sensitive to red one is sensitive to blue and one is sensitive to green so when you see something blue the blue eye cone starts getting sensitive so you can see the color 
E-BS,L-EE,explanation,objects,When we look at a red rose the red eye cone color bounces off into our eye and the other two colors absorb so you see the color of the rose 
E-BS,L-E,explanation,objects,When we see a yellow rose blue would absorb and green and red would bounce off into our eye which makes yellow 
E-BS,L-F,fact,materials,A transparent object is clear and lets 100 light pass through 
E-BS,L-F,fact,materials,A translucent object is clear swell but only lets 50 go through 
E-BS,L-F,fact,materials,An opaque object lets 0 through 
E-BS,L-F,fact,reflection,The law of reflection on a flat mirror is The angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection 
E-S,L-EE,explanation,travel,When we had the class debate I was the only student who was not on a side because my theory was light travels in waves but the waves go in a strait line and the debate was between straight line and waves And now we have lots of ideas from the debate and we don't know which one is right now is light travels sort of like this Light travels in a straight line but appears to be wavy or light travels in waves but appears to be straight That means that light has aspects of both straight lines and waves It depends on how you look at it Or what your experiment is trying to prove In our class we have seen experiments that prove both that light travels in straight lines box with powder and shadow experiments and wavy lines Thomas Young experiment 
E-H,L-EE,explanation,pri&sec,My understanding of Light The colors of light Light is made up of many many different colors You cannot see those colors because those colors mixed together to get white light White light is transparent so you cant see it 
E-BS,L-EE,explanation,rainbow,When it rains the raindrops split the light so you can see 7 discolored orange yellow green blue indigo and violet that make a rainbow 
E-S,L-EE,explanation,objects,The way you see what color everything is is because of light hitting your eye when their is a green leaf the light hits it before it splits up it is called white light the green leaf absorbs the other colors but the green keeps going because it is the same color The green light keeps going until it goes into your eye Then the brain identifies what color and it is 
E-BS,L-EF,fact,postimage,Cones are things that respond to colored light There are three kinds of light that cones respond to Red blue and green 
E-BS,L-EE,explanation,postimage,Cones tire easily If you were looking at a green apple the cone that responds to green light gets tired So when you look at a piece of white paper the green cone would be to tired but the red and blue wouldn't and red and blue make purple And purple is the opposite of green on the color wheel 
E-BS,L-EF,fact,prism,Light is the colors of the rainbow compressed to make white light A prism splits up light into separate colorsred orange yellow green blue indigo violet 
E-BS,L-EE,explanation,rainbow,This is why the colors of the rainbow are in the same order As you know there are seven colors that we know of They all travel at a the same wave frequency and they get mixed But when light goes through something like rain the frequency of the light waves get differed For some reason red always has the longest frequency and purple has the shortest 
E-BS,L-EF,fact,pri&sec,There are different names for the colors of light Those names are the primary colors of light and the secondary colors of light There not just named orally The primary colors are the first colors that make up the secondary colors 
E-S,L-EF,fact,pri&sec,The primary colors are red blue and green The same colors as your eye cones 
E-S,L-F,fact,pri&sec,The secondary colors are yellow cyan and magenta yellow indigo and purple 
E-S,L-F,fact,pri&sec,Red and blue make magenta 
E-S,L-F,fact,pri&sec,Blue and green make cyan and 
E-S,L-F,fact,pri&sec,green and red make yellow 
E-S,L-F,fact,pri&sec,All three primary colors make white 
E-BS,L-EE,explanation,objects,That is why when you look at a yellow thing the red and green light bounce of it but blue gets absorbs mixes and comes to your eye as yellow 
E-BS,L-EE,explanation,northern,A thing that involves color and is very magnificent is the northern lights This happens because of magnetic disturbances of the sun The sun sends out particles of electricity that are microscopic The earths atmosphere makes the air electrified and then it glow The colors that glow are red pink and green 
E-BS,L-F,fact,reflection,Light and materials The most useful materials to use in experiments about light are lenses and mirrors But first mirrors There are two kinds of mirrors There names are concave and convex 
E-S,L-EF,fact,reflection,A convex mirror is shaped like a belly and a concave mirror is shaped like a cave 
E-S,L-EF,fact,reflection,A concave mirror concentrates the light and a convex mirror does the opposite 
E-S,L-EF,fact,reflection,A convex mirror since it spreads the light out lets you see more of the stuff behind you A concave mirror since it concentrates light lets you see close up Concave mirrors are used by doctors to see up close 
E-BS,L-F,fact,reflection,You cant forget flat mirrors There sort of in the middle Flat mirrors are pretty important to 
E-S,L-EF,fact,reflection,They also have something called the law of reflection The law of reflection is the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection To clarify that if light hits a flat mirror at say a 75 degree angle it is going to come off the mirror at a 75 degree angle 
E-H,L-F,fact,reflection,That law only works for smooth mirrors though 
E-BS,L-F,fact,diffused,On bumpy mirrors the reflected ray would go in all directions That is a called a diffused reflection 
E-BS,L-F,fact,lens,Now lenses There are two kinds of lenses Concave and convex Just like the mirrors they do the same things 
E-BS,L-EF,fact,lens,You can add another lens to one of those lenses also A double concave lens would spread out the light and a double convex would concentrate the light 
E-S,L-F,fact,lens,Lenses are transparent 
E-S,L-F,fact,materials,There are two other forms that Translucent and opaque 
E-BS,L-F,fact,materials,A transparent object means see through 
E-H,L-F,fact,materials,a translucent object colors the light and 
E-S,L-F,fact,materials,an opaque object means that it stops the light completely 
E-BS,L-EE,explanation,sunpanel,There are also things called solar panels They are made to catch light The light that they catch is used to make electricity Solar panels probably have a lot of tubes connected 
E-BS,L-EF,fact,glow,There are two kinds of light Natural and artificial Natural light is light from a natural light source and artificial light is something that is made from a artificial light source like light bulbs 
E-H,L-EF,fact,bio,But first natural light There are two sections that I am going to write about First photoluminescence Photoluminescence is made from a living thing Like electric sale They make their own light Therefore electric sale are electroluminescent So are glow worms squids fireflies and even bacteria and fungi 
E-BS,L-F,fact,glow,Now  artificial light First chemiluminescence Chemiluminescence is when chemicals react to make light 
E-H,L-EF,fact,glow,The second thing is fluorescence That is made with friction Like when two stones rub together They make fire whits is heat and light That is fluorescence 
E-BS,L-F,fact,laser,Then there are lasers Lasers are extremely bright and very strong They can go through anything 
,L-EF,fact,laser,News flash If you put a red balloon inside a white balloon and shine a laser at it the laser will pop the red balloon but the white balloon will be unharmed 
E-S,L-EE,explanation,shadow,A shadow is the darkness on the other side of an opaque object whits is nontransparent When a light shines on an opaque object the light cant get around it so there is only darkness whits is a shadow 
E-BS,L-F,fact,shadow,There are two different ways you can play with shadows One is an umbra and the other is a penumbra 
E-BS,L-EF,fact,shadow,And umbra is made when you shine a light source over an object that is bigger than the light source That makes a big shadow that is pretty darker 
E-BS,L-EF,fact,shadow,A penumbra is when you shine a light source on something that is smaller than the light source That makes a little umbra and a penumbra which is lighter 
E-BS,L-F,fact,eclipse,Those are the small the things to do with shadows but there are much bigger things Those things are eclipses There are two eclipses that we know of Solar and lunar 
E-S,L-EE,explanation,eclipse,A lunate eclipse is when the art goes between the moon and the sun The sun hits the eart and the eart casts a shadow on the moon winch give the moon total darkness 
E-S,L-EE,explanation,eclipse,A solar eclipse is when the moon is in the middle and blocks the light from hitting the earth making that side dark 
E-BS,L-E,explanation,see,1 Is it true that all we see is light My theory is that all you see is light bouncing off things in to our eyes 
E-BS,L-E,explanation,see,2 How do we see an object that is transparent translucent or opaque Opaque light bounces off it into your eyes 
E-BS,L-E,explanation,see,Transparent solid light bounces off it because it is a solid and you can see it very faintly 
E-BS,L-E,explanation,see,Translucent more light bounces off then transparent but less light bounces off then opaque objects 
E-S,L-F,fact,see,3 Is it true that we cant see without light Of course not 
E-H,L-EE,explanation,travel,1 How do you think light travels My theory is that since light doesn't travel on anything it has to make enough energy to keep going My theory is that there are little wavelets of energy that travel inside bigger straight lines Like a flashlight That also explains why light is hot

E-S,L-EE,explanation,shadow,People make shadows by just standing in the light Because light travels in a titrate line or Waveland it hits a portion or thing and the blocks the light so it cant reach the ground and thee for makes an outline of that object 
E-BS,L-F,fact,glow,There are 2 rinds of light natural and artificial The kind of light that is in your home is artificial if all the windows are covers 
E-BS,L-F,fact,bio,Photoluminescence is light made by animals such as fireflies and the tiny fish that live at the bottom of the sea winch my mom loves 
E-BS,L-E,explanation,objects,Reflecting and absorbing say if there was a red rose and red light hit it it would bounce off And blue light hit it it would absorb 
E-PS,L-F,fact,northern,The aurora Borealis is very bucketful it is light that hits the sky probably threw water that is why it looks waive 
E-H,L-EF,fact,postimage,Eye cones are things that are in your eyes and they see every thing is upside down The image goes threw the eye cone and to the brain and the brain turns it rightsize 
E-S,L-F,fact,pri&sec,fl you want to make white light you mix red blue and green together and you have white light 
E-BS,L-EF,fact,prism&rainbow,fl you want to make a rainbow you put a prism down and you shine a flashlight at it All the colors will come out the other side
E-BS,L-E,explanation,rainbow,If you want a natural rainbow when it rains the rain drops act like prisms and make a rainbow 
E-H,L-E,explanation,objects,How we see a red flower is it goad through your eye and it is upside down The solution to this problem is that your brain turns it around

E-S,L-EF,fact,shadow,When colored light is shined at a opaque object the shadow is black like a normal shadow but when you shine two colored lights there are two shadow and the colors are the colors of the light 
E-S,L-EF,fact,sundial,Sundials are a form of telling time You can tell the time by the position of the shadow 
E-BS,L-EF,fact,shadow,Shadows also are used to tell directions like north and south you also look at the shadow and that will tell you the direction you are walking in 
E-S,L-E,explanation,travel,light travels in all directions I need to understand does light travel in a strait line or something else My theory's that light travels in wave lines but they appear straight 
E-BS,L-E,explanation,see,All we see is light 
E-S,L-F,fact,pri&sec,the primary colors of light are red green and blue 
E-S,L-F,fact,pri&sec,The secondary colors of light are Yellow magenta and cyan 
E-S,L-F,fact,pri&sec,White light is made from the primary colors mixed 
E-BS,L-EE,explanation,objects,If a white light is shined on a red flower the green and blue is absorbed and the red is reflected that is how we see a red flower 
E-BS,L-E,explanation,pri&sec,if you shine white light on a yellow flower the red and green is reflected and the blue is absorbed 
E-BS,L-F,fact,prism&rainbow,If you shine light on a prism it makes a rainbow
E-BS,L-E,explanation,rainbow,We belove that a rain drop can make a rainbow 
E-BS,L-F,fact,postimage,Eye cones are cones in your eyes that help you see colors 
E-BS,L-F,fact,northern,Northern lights are colored lights 
E-BS,L-F,fact,materials,Transparent objects are objects that can not be seen through and are opaque 
E-BS,L-F,fact,materials,Translucent objects are objects are you can see through but not perfectly 
E-BS,L-F,fact,materials,An opaque object is a object that is sold and cannot be seen through 
E-BS,L-EF,fact,reflection,A concave mirror is a mirror that goes in and when light is shewn on it the light gets focused 
E-BS,L-EF,fact,reflection,A convex mirror is a mirror that goes out and when you shine light on it the light bounces off straight looking 
E-BS,L-F,fact,reflection,The law of reflection is the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection 
E-BS,L-F,fact,diffused,If you shine a light source on a crinkly piece of tinfoil the reflection goes every where and is called a diffuse reflection 
E-BS,L-F,fact,lens,A concave lens goes in 
E-BS,L-F,fact,lens,and a convex lens goes out 
E-BS,L-F,fact,sunpanel,Solar panels are panels used with light 
E-BS,L-F,fact,bio,Photoluminescence is a animal that makes its own light 
E-BS,L-F,fact,glow,Chemiluminescence is chemical made light 
E-BS,L-F,fact,glow,fluorescence is things that glow like a glow sticks from a party 
E-BS,L-F,fact,laser,Lasers are a really strong form of light
