L-RS,"Evolution is the change that eventually happens over millions of years to better adapt to a habitat or environment change. For example, in the beginning of the world, all the life was simply a few cells floation in the ocean. Then they eventually adapted to ocean life by taking on the form of a axolotl-like fish/lizard. Then they grew legs and lungs and came to land as an early form of lizards. These adapted into dinosaurs. Dinosaurs went extinct, but many species of moles and mice.

L-RF,"Evolution is the change that eventually happens over millions of years to better adapt to a habitat or environment change. For example, in the beginning of the world, all the life was simply a few cells floation in the ocean. Then they eventually adapted to ocean life by taking on the form of a axolotl-like fish/lizard. Then they grew legs and lungs and came to land as an early form of lizards. These adapted into dinosaurs. Dinosaurs went extinct, but many species of moles and mice. These adapted into other animals, and those animals adapted, and that is how evolution basically works. Here is a link to my slideshow! I hope you enjoy it and learn from it.

Lots of people, plants, and animals need water from those rivers. And some scientists and engineers have worked together to use the energy from melting glaciers to generate electricity. But, we don’t want them to melt too much. As more glacier water melts and flows to the ocean, the sea level gets higher, which can create a lot of problems. 5.Why can’t we drink the ocean? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPyr0JrTmpo (Link->https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPyr0JrTmpo) The main thing your kidneys do is to make urine, otherwise known as pee.
